Listen to this funeral song I am singing:\n\n“The virgin Israel has fallen,\nnever to rise again!\nShe lies abandoned on the ground,\nwith no one to help her up.”\n\nThe Sovereign LORD says:\n\n“When a city sends a thousand men to battle,\nonly a hundred will return.\nWhen a town sends a hundred,\nonly ten will come back alive.”\n\nNow this is what the LORD says to the family of Israel:\n\n“Come back to me and live!\nDon’t worship at the pagan altars at Bethel;\ndon’t go to the shrines at Gilgal or Beersheba.\nFor the people of Gilgal will be dragged off into exile,\nand the people of Bethel will be reduced to nothing.”\nCome back to the LORD and live!\nOtherwise, he will roar through Israel like a fire,\ndevouring you completely.\nYour gods in Bethel\nwon’t be able to quench the flames.\nYou twist justice, making it a bitter pill for the oppressed.\nYou treat the righteous like dirt.\n\nIt is the LORD who created the stars,\nthe Pleiades and Orion.\nHe turns darkness into morning\nand day into night.\nHe draws up water from the oceans\nand pours it down as rain on the land.\nThe LORD is his name!\nWith blinding speed and power he destroys the strong,\ncrushing all their defenses.\n\nHow you hate honest judges!\nHow you despise people who tell the truth!\nYou trample the poor,\nstealing their grain through taxes and unfair rent.\nTherefore, though you build beautiful stone houses,\nyou will never live in them.\nThough you plant lush vineyards,\nyou will never drink wine from them.\nFor I know the vast number of your sins\nand the depth of your rebellions.\nYou oppress good people by taking bribes\nand deprive the poor of justice in the courts.\nSo those who are smart keep their mouths shut,\nfor it is an evil time.\n\nDo what is good and run from evil\nso that you may live!\nThen the LORD God of Heaven’s Armies will be your helper,\njust as you have claimed.\nHate evil and love what is good;\nturn your courts into true halls of justice.\nPerhaps even yet the LORD God of Heaven’s Armies\nwill have mercy on the remnant of his people.\n\nTherefore, this is what the Lord, the LORD God of Heaven’s Armies, says:\n\n“There will be crying in all the public squares\nand mourning in every street.\nCall for the farmers to weep with you,\nand summon professional mourners to wail.\nThere will be wailing in every vineyard,\nfor I will destroy them all,”\nsays the LORD.\n\nWhat sorrow awaits you who say,\n“If only the day of the LORD were here!”\nYou have no idea what you are wishing for.\nThat day will bring darkness, not light.\nIn that day you will be like a man who runs from a lion—\nonly to meet a bear.\nEscaping from the bear, he leans his hand against a wall in his house—\nand he’s bitten by a snake.\nYes, the day of the LORD will be dark and hopeless,\nwithout a ray of joy or hope.\n\n“I hate all your show and pretense—\nthe hypocrisy of your religious festivals and solemn assemblies.\nI will not accept your burnt offerings and grain offerings.\nI won’t even notice all your choice peace offerings.\nAway with your noisy hymns of praise!\nI will not listen to the music of your harps.\nInstead, I want to see a mighty flood of justice,\nan endless river of righteous living.\n\n“Was it to me you were bringing sacrifices and offerings during the forty years in the wilderness, Israel? No, you served your pagan gods—Sakkuth your king god and Kaiwan your star god—the images you made for yourselves. So I will send you into exile, to a land east of Damascus,” says the LORD, whose name is the God of Heaven’s Armies.",

Then I said, “O Sovereign LORD, please forgive us or we will not survive, for Israel is so small.”\nSo the LORD relented from this plan. “I will not do it,” he said.\n\nThen the Sovereign LORD showed me another vision. I saw him preparing to punish his people with a great fire. The fire had burned up the depths of the sea and was devouring the entire land. Then I said, “O Sovereign LORD, please stop or we will not survive, for Israel is so small.”\nThen the LORD relented from this plan, too. “I will not do that either,” said the Sovereign LORD.\n\nThen he showed me another vision. I saw the Lord standing beside a wall that had been built using a plumb line. He was using a plumb line to see if it was still straight. And the LORD said to me, “Amos, what do you see?”\nI answered, “A plumb line.”\nAnd the Lord replied, “I will test my people with this plumb line. I will no longer ignore all their sins. The pagan shrines of your ancestors will be ruined, and the temples of Israel will be destroyed; I will bring the dynasty of King Jeroboam to a sudden end.”\n\nThen Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent a message to Jeroboam, king of Israel: “Amos is hatching a plot against you right here on your very doorstep! What he is saying is intolerable. He is saying, ‘Jeroboam will soon be killed, and the people of Israel will be sent away into exile.’”\nThen Amaziah sent orders to Amos: “Get out of here, you prophet! Go on back to the land of Judah, and earn your living by prophesying there! Don’t bother us with your prophecies here in Bethel. This is the king’s sanctuary and the national place of worship!”\nBut Amos replied, “I’m not a professional prophet, and I was never trained to be one. I’m just a shepherd, and I take care of sycamore-fig trees. But the LORD called me away from my flock and told me, ‘Go and prophesy to my people in Israel.’ Now then, listen to this message from the LORD:\n\n“You say,\n‘Don’t prophesy against Israel.\nStop preaching against my people.’\nBut this is what the LORD says:\n‘Your wife will become a prostitute in this city,\nand your sons and daughters will be killed.\nYour land will be divided up,\nand you yourself will die in a foreign land.\nAnd the people of Israel will certainly become captives in exile,\nfar from their homeland.’”",
