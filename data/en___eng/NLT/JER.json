The LORD first gave messages to Jeremiah during the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah. The LORD’s messages continued throughout the reign of King Jehoiakim, Josiah’s son, until the eleventh year of the reign of King Zedekiah, another of Josiah’s sons. In August of that eleventh year the people of Jerusalem were taken away as captives.\n\nThe LORD gave me this message:\n\n“I knew you before I formed you in your mother’s womb.\nBefore you were born I set you apart\nand appointed you as my prophet to the nations.”\n\n“O Sovereign LORD,” I said, “I can’t speak for you! I’m too young!”\nThe LORD replied, “Don’t say, ‘I’m too young,’ for you must go wherever I send you and say whatever I tell you. And don’t be afraid of the people, for I will be with you and will protect you. I, the LORD, have spoken!” Then the LORD reached out and touched my mouth and said,\n\n“Look, I have put my words in your mouth!\nToday I appoint you to stand up\nagainst nations and kingdoms.\nSome you must uproot and tear down,\ndestroy and overthrow.\nOthers you must build up\nand plant.”\n\nThen the LORD said to me, “Look, Jeremiah! What do you see?”\nAnd I replied, “I see a branch from an almond tree.”\nAnd the LORD said, “That’s right, and it means that I am watching, and I will certainly carry out all my plans.”\nThen the LORD spoke to me again and asked, “What do you see now?”\nAnd I replied, “I see a pot of boiling water, spilling from the north.”\n“Yes,” the LORD said, “for terror from the north will boil out on the people of this land. Listen! I am calling the armies of the kingdoms of the north to come to Jerusalem. I, the LORD, have spoken!\n\n“They will set their thrones\nat the gates of the city.\nThey will attack its walls\nand all the other towns of Judah.\nI will pronounce judgment\non my people for all their evil—\nfor deserting me and burning incense to other gods.\nYes, they worship idols made with their own hands!\n\n“Get up and prepare for action.\nGo out and tell them everything I tell you to say.\nDo not be afraid of them,\nor I will make you look foolish in front of them.\nFor see, today I have made you strong\nlike a fortified city that cannot be captured,\nlike an iron pillar or a bronze wall.\nYou will stand against the whole land—\nthe kings, officials, priests, and people of Judah.\nThey will fight you, but they will fail.\nFor I am with you, and I will take care of you.\nI, the LORD, have spoken!”",

      "chapter_text": "LORD\nThe LORD gave me another message. He said, “Go and shout this message to Jerusalem. This is what the LORD says:\n\n“I remember how eager you were to please me\nas a young bride long ago,\nhow you loved me and followed me\neven through the barren wilderness.\nIn those days Israel was holy to the LORD,\nthe first of his children.\nAll who harmed his people were declared guilty,\nand disaster fell on them.\nI, the LORD, have spoken!”\n\nListen to the word of the LORD, people of Jacob—all you families of Israel! This is what the LORD says:\n\n“What did your ancestors find wrong with me\nthat led them to stray so far from me?\nThey worshiped worthless idols,\nonly to become worthless themselves.\nThey did not ask, ‘Where is the LORD\nwho brought us safely out of Egypt\nand led us through the barren wilderness—\na land of deserts and pits,\na land of drought and death,\nwhere no one lives or even travels?’\n\n“And when I brought you into a fruitful land\nto enjoy its bounty and goodness,\nyou defiled my land\nand corrupted the possession I had promised you.\nThe priests did not ask,\n‘Where is the LORD?’\nThose who taught my word ignored me,\nthe rulers turned against me,\nand the prophets spoke in the name of Baal,\nwasting their time on worthless idols.\nTherefore, I will bring my case against you,”\nsays the LORD.\n“I will even bring charges against your children’s children\nin the years to come.\n\n“Go west and look in the land of Cyprus;\ngo east and search through the land of Kedar.\nHas anyone ever heard of anything\nas strange as this?\nHas any nation ever traded its gods for new ones,\neven though they are not gods at all?\nYet my people have exchanged their glorious God\nfor worthless idols!\nThe heavens are shocked at such a thing\nand shrink back in horror and dismay,”\nsays the LORD.\n“For my people have done two evil things:\nThey have abandoned me—\nthe fountain of living water.\nAnd they have dug for themselves cracked cisterns\nthat can hold no water at all!\n\n“Why has Israel become a slave?\nWhy has he been carried away as plunder?\nStrong lions have roared against him,\nand the land has been destroyed.\nThe towns are now in ruins,\nand no one lives in them anymore.\nEgyptians, marching from their cities of Memphis and Tahpanhes,\nhave destroyed Israel’s glory and power.\nAnd you have brought this upon yourselves\nby rebelling against the LORD your God,\neven though he was leading you on the way!\n\n“What have you gained by your alliances with Egypt\nand your covenants with Assyria?\nWhat good to you are the streams of the Nile\nor the waters of the Euphrates River?\nYour wickedness will bring its own punishment.\nYour turning from me will shame you.\nYou will see what an evil, bitter thing it is\nto abandon the LORD your God and not to fear him.\nI, the Lord, the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, have spoken!\n\n“Long ago I broke the yoke that oppressed you\nand tore away the chains of your slavery,\nbut still you said,\n‘I will not serve you.’\nOn every hill and under every green tree,\nyou have prostituted yourselves by bowing down to idols.\nBut I was the one who planted you,\nchoosing a vine of the purest stock—the very best.\nHow did you grow into this corrupt wild vine?\nNo amount of soap or lye can make you clean.\nI still see the stain of your guilt.\nI, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken!\n\n“You say, ‘That’s not true!\nI haven’t worshiped the images of Baal!’\nBut how can you say that?\nGo and look in any valley in the land!\nFace the awful sins you have done.\nYou are like a restless female camel\ndesperately searching for a mate.\nYou are like a wild donkey,\nsniffing the wind at mating time.\nWho can restrain her lust?\nThose who desire her don’t need to search,\nfor she goes running to them!\nWhen will you stop running?\nWhen will you stop panting after other gods?\nBut you say, ‘Save your breath.\nI’m in love with these foreign gods,\nand I can’t stop loving them now!’\n\n“Israel is like a thief\nwho feels shame only when he gets caught.\nThey, their kings, officials, priests, and prophets—\nall are alike in this.\nTo an image carved from a piece of wood they say,\n‘You are my father.’\nTo an idol chiseled from a block of stone they say,\n‘You are my mother.’\nThey turn their backs on me,\nbut in times of trouble they cry out to me,\n‘Come and save us!’\nBut why not call on these gods you have made?\nWhen trouble comes, let them save you if they can!\nFor you have as many gods\nas there are towns in Judah.\nWhy do you accuse me of doing wrong?\nYou are the ones who have rebelled,”\nsays the LORD.\n“I have punished your children,\nbut they did not respond to my discipline.\nYou yourselves have killed your prophets\nas a lion kills its prey.\n\n“O my people, listen to the words of the LORD!\nHave I been like a desert to Israel?\nHave I been to them a land of darkness?\nWhy then do my people say, ‘At last we are free from God!\nWe don’t need him anymore!’\nDoes a young woman forget her jewelry,\nor a bride her wedding dress?\nYet for years on end\nmy people have forgotten me.\n\n“How you plot and scheme to win your lovers.\nEven an experienced prostitute could learn from you!\nYour clothing is stained with the blood of the innocent and the poor,\nthough you didn’t catch them breaking into your houses!\nAnd yet you say,\n‘I have done nothing wrong.\nSurely God isn’t angry with me!’\nBut now I will punish you severely\nbecause you claim you have not sinned.\nFirst here, then there—\nyou flit from one ally to another asking for help.\nBut your new friends in Egypt will let you down,\njust as Assyria did before.\nIn despair, you will be led into exile\nwith your hands on your heads,\nfor the LORD has rejected the nations you trust.\nThey will not help you at all.",

Like a wife who commits adultery, Israel has worshiped other gods on every hill and under every green tree. I thought, ‘After she has done all this, she will return to me.’ But she did not return, and her faithless sister Judah saw this. She saw that I divorced faithless Israel because of her adultery. But that treacherous sister Judah had no fear, and now she, too, has left me and given herself to prostitution. Israel treated it all so lightly—she thought nothing of committing adultery by worshiping idols made of wood and stone. So now the land has been polluted. But despite all this, her faithless sister Judah has never sincerely returned to me. She has only pretended to be sorry. I, the LORD, have spoken!”\n\nThen the LORD said to me, “Even faithless Israel is less guilty than treacherous Judah! Therefore, go and give this message to Israel. This is what the LORD says:\n\n“O Israel, my faithless people,\ncome home to me again,\nfor I am merciful.\nI will not be angry with you forever.\nOnly acknowledge your guilt.\nAdmit that you rebelled against the LORD your God\nand committed adultery against him\nby worshiping idols under every green tree.\nConfess that you refused to listen to my voice.\nI, the LORD, have spoken!\n\n“Return home, you wayward children,”\nsays the LORD,\n“for I am your master.\nI will bring you back to the land of Israel—\none from this town and two from that family—\nfrom wherever you are scattered.\nAnd I will give you shepherds after my own heart,\nwho will guide you with knowledge and understanding.\n\n“And when your land is once more filled with people,” says the LORD, “you will no longer wish for ‘the good old days’ when you possessed the Ark of the LORD’s Covenant. You will not miss those days or even remember them, and there will be no need to rebuild the Ark. In that day Jerusalem will be known as ‘The Throne of the LORD.’ All nations will come there to honor the LORD. They will no longer stubbornly follow their own evil desires. In those days the people of Judah and Israel will return together from exile in the north. They will return to the land I gave your ancestors as an inheritance forever.\n\n“I thought to myself,\n‘I would love to treat you as my own children!’\nI wanted nothing more than to give you this beautiful land—\nthe finest possession in the world.\nI looked forward to your calling me ‘Father,’\nand I wanted you never to turn from me.\nBut you have been unfaithful to me, you people of Israel!\nYou have been like a faithless wife who leaves her husband.\nI, the LORD, have spoken.”\n\nVoices are heard high on the windswept mountains,\nthe weeping and pleading of Israel’s people.\nFor they have chosen crooked paths\nand have forgotten the LORD their God.\n\n“My wayward children,” says the LORD,\n“come back to me, and I will heal your wayward hearts.”\n\n“Yes, we’re coming,” the people reply,\n“for you are the LORD our God.\nOur worship of idols on the hills\nand our religious orgies on the mountains\nare a delusion.\nOnly in the LORD our God\nwill Israel ever find salvation.\nFrom childhood we have watched\nas everything our ancestors worked for—\ntheir flocks and herds, their sons and daughters—\nwas squandered on a delusion.\nLet us now lie down in shame\nand cover ourselves with dishonor,\nfor we and our ancestors have sinned\nagainst the LORD our God.\nFrom our childhood to this day\nwe have never obeyed him.”",

Do not delay!’\nFor I am bringing terrible destruction upon you\nfrom the north.”\n\nA lion stalks from its den,\na destroyer of nations.\nIt has left its lair and is headed your way.\nIt’s going to devastate your land!\nYour towns will lie in ruins,\nwith no one living in them anymore.\nSo put on clothes of mourning\nand weep with broken hearts,\nfor the fierce anger of the LORD\nis still upon us.\n\n“In that day,” says the LORD,\n“the king and the officials will tremble in fear.\nThe priests will be struck with horror,\nand the prophets will be appalled.”\n\nThen I said, “O Sovereign LORD,\nthe people have been deceived by what you said,\nfor you promised peace for Jerusalem.\nBut the sword is held at their throats!”\n\nThe time is coming when the LORD will say\nto the people of Jerusalem,\n“My dear people, a burning wind is blowing in from the desert,\nand it’s not a gentle breeze useful for winnowing grain.\nIt is a roaring blast sent by me!\nNow I will pronounce your destruction!”\n\nOur enemy rushes down on us like storm clouds!\nHis chariots are like whirlwinds.\nHis horses are swifter than eagles.\nHow terrible it will be, for we are doomed!\nO Jerusalem, cleanse your heart\nthat you may be saved.\nHow long will you harbor\nyour evil thoughts?\nYour destruction has been announced\nfrom Dan and the hill country of Ephraim.\n\n“Warn the surrounding nations\nand announce this to Jerusalem:\nThe enemy is coming from a distant land,\nraising a battle cry against the towns of Judah.\nThey surround Jerusalem like watchmen around a field,\nfor my people have rebelled against me,”\nsays the LORD.\n“Your own actions have brought this upon you.\nThis punishment is bitter, piercing you to the heart!”\n\nMy heart, my heart—I writhe in pain!\nMy heart pounds within me! I cannot be still.\nFor I have heard the blast of enemy trumpets\nand the roar of their battle cries.\nWaves of destruction roll over the land,\nuntil it lies in complete desolation.\nSuddenly my tents are destroyed;\nin a moment my shelters are crushed.\nHow long must I see the battle flags\nand hear the trumpets of war?\n\n“My people are foolish\nand do not know me,” says the LORD.\n“They are stupid children\nwho have no understanding.\nThey are clever enough at doing wrong,\nbut they have no idea how to do right!”\n\nI looked at the earth, and it was empty and formless.\nI looked at the heavens, and there was no light.\nI looked at the mountains and hills,\nand they trembled and shook.\nI looked, and all the people were gone.\nAll the birds of the sky had flown away.\nI looked, and the fertile fields had become a wilderness.\nThe towns lay in ruins,\ncrushed by the LORD’s fierce anger.\n\nThis is what the LORD says:\n“The whole land will be ruined,\nbut I will not destroy it completely.\nThe earth will mourn\nand the heavens will be draped in black\nbecause of my decree against my people.\nI have made up my mind and will not change it.”\n\nAt the noise of charioteers and archers,\nthe people flee in terror.\nThey hide in the bushes\nand run for the mountains.\nAll the towns have been abandoned—\nnot a person remains!\nWhat are you doing,\nyou who have been plundered?\nWhy do you dress up in beautiful clothing\nand put on gold jewelry?\nWhy do you brighten your eyes with mascara?\nYour primping will do you no good!\nThe allies who were your lovers\ndespise you and seek to kill you.\n\nI hear a cry, like that of a woman in labor,\nthe groans of a woman giving birth to her first child.\nIt is beautiful Jerusalem\ngasping for breath and crying out,\n“Help!

Now you will serve foreigners in a land that is not your own.’\n\n“Make this announcement to Israel,\nand say this to Judah:\nListen, you foolish and senseless people,\nwith eyes that do not see\nand ears that do not hear.\nHave you no respect for me?\nWhy don’t you tremble in my presence?\nI, the LORD, define the ocean’s sandy shoreline\nas an everlasting boundary that the waters cannot cross.\nThe waves may toss and roar,\nbut they can never pass the boundaries I set.\nBut my people have stubborn and rebellious hearts.\nThey have turned away and abandoned me.\nThey do not say from the heart,\n‘Let us live in awe of the LORD our God,\nfor he gives us rain each spring and fall,\nassuring us of a harvest when the time is right.’\nYour wickedness has deprived you of these wonderful blessings.\nYour sin has robbed you of all these good things.\n\n“Among my people are wicked men\nwho lie in wait for victims like a hunter hiding in a blind.\nThey continually set traps\nto catch people.\nLike a cage filled with birds,\ntheir homes are filled with evil plots.\nAnd now they are great and rich.\nThey are fat and sleek,\nand there is no limit to their wicked deeds.\nThey refuse to provide justice to orphans\nand deny the rights of the poor.\nShould I not punish them for this?” says the LORD.\n“Should I not avenge myself against such a nation?\nA horrible and shocking thing\nhas happened in this land—\nthe prophets give false prophecies,\nand the priests rule with an iron hand.\nWorse yet, my people like it that way!\nBut what will you do when the end comes?",

We won’t pay attention!’\n\n“Therefore, listen to this, all you nations.\nTake note of my people’s situation.\nListen, all the earth!\nI will bring disaster on my people.\nIt is the fruit of their own schemes,\nbecause they refuse to listen to me.\nThey have rejected my word.\nThere’s no use offering me sweet frankincense from Sheba.\nKeep your fragrant calamus imported from distant lands!\nI will not accept your burnt offerings.\nYour sacrifices have no pleasing aroma for me.”\n\nTherefore, this is what the LORD says:\n“I will put obstacles in my people’s path.\nFathers and sons will both fall over them.\nNeighbors and friends will die together.”\n\nThis is what the LORD says:\n“Look! A great army coming from the north!\nA great nation is rising against you from far-off lands.\nThey are armed with bows and spears.\nThey are cruel and show no mercy.\nThey sound like a roaring sea\nas they ride forward on horses.\nThey are coming in battle formation,\nplanning to destroy you, beautiful Jerusalem.”\n\nWe have heard reports about the enemy,\nand we wring our hands in fright.\nPangs of anguish have gripped us,\nlike those of a woman in labor.\nDon’t go out to the fields!\nDon’t travel on the roads!\nThe enemy’s sword is everywhere\nand terrorizes us at every turn!\nOh, my people, dress yourselves in burlap\nand sit among the ashes.\nMourn and weep bitterly, as for the loss of an only son.\nFor suddenly the destroying armies will be upon you!\n\n“Jeremiah, I have made you a tester of metals,\nthat you may determine the quality of my people.\nThey are the worst kind of rebel,\nfull of slander.\nThey are as hard as bronze and iron,\nand they lead others into corruption.\nThe bellows fiercely fan the flames\nto burn out the corruption.\nBut it does not purify them,\nfor the wickedness remains.\nI will label them ‘Rejected Silver,’\nfor I, the LORD, am discarding them.”",

He said, “Go to the entrance of the LORD’s Temple, and give this message to the people: ‘O Judah, listen to this message from the LORD! Listen to it, all of you who worship here! This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says:\n“‘Even now, if you quit your evil ways, I will let you stay in your own land. But don’t be fooled by those who promise you safety simply because the LORD’s Temple is here. They chant, “The LORD’s Temple is here! The LORD’s Temple is here!” But I will be merciful only if you stop your evil thoughts and deeds and start treating each other with justice; only if you stop exploiting foreigners, orphans, and widows; only if you stop your murdering; and only if you stop harming yourselves by worshiping idols. Then I will let you stay in this land that I gave to your ancestors to keep forever.\n“‘Don’t be fooled into thinking that you will never suffer because the Temple is here. It’s a lie! Do you really think you can steal, murder, commit adultery, lie, and burn incense to Baal and all those other new gods of yours, and then come here and stand before me in my Temple and chant, “We are safe!”—only to go right back to all those evils again? Don’t you yourselves admit that this Temple, which bears my name, has become a den of thieves? Surely I see all the evil going on there. I, the LORD, have spoken!\n“‘Go now to the place at Shiloh where I once put the Tabernacle that bore my name. See what I did there because of all the wickedness of my people, the Israelites. While you were doing these wicked things, says the LORD, I spoke to you about it repeatedly, but you would not listen. I called out to you, but you refused to answer. So just as I destroyed Shiloh, I will now destroy this Temple that bears my name, this Temple that you trust in for help, this place that I gave to you and your ancestors. And I will send you out of my sight into exile, just as I did your relatives, the people of Israel.’\n\n“Pray no more for these people, Jeremiah. Do not weep or pray for them, and don’t beg me to help them, for I will not listen to you. Don’t you see what they are doing throughout the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? No wonder I am so angry! Watch how the children gather wood and the fathers build sacrificial fires. See how the women knead dough and make cakes to offer to the Queen of Heaven. And they pour out liquid offerings to their other idol gods! Am I the one they are hurting?” asks the LORD. “Most of all, they hurt themselves, to their own shame.”\nSo this is what the Sovereign LORD says: “I will pour out my terrible fury on this place. Its people, animals, trees, and crops will be consumed by the unquenchable fire of my anger.”\nThis is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: “Take your burnt offerings and your other sacrifices and eat them yourselves! When I led your ancestors out of Egypt, it was not burnt offerings and sacrifices I wanted from them. This is what I told them: ‘Obey me, and I will be your God, and you will be my people. Do everything as I say, and all will be well!’\n“But my people would not listen to me. They kept doing whatever they wanted, following the stubborn desires of their evil hearts. They went backward instead of forward. From the day your ancestors left Egypt until now, I have continued to send my servants, the prophets—day in and day out. But my people have not listened to me or even tried to hear. They have been stubborn and sinful—even worse than their ancestors.\n“Tell them all this, but do not expect them to listen. Shout out your warnings, but do not expect them to respond. Say to them, ‘This is the nation whose people will not obey the LORD their God and who refuse to be taught. Truth has vanished from among them; it is no longer heard on their lips. Shave your head in mourning, and weep alone on the mountains. For the LORD has rejected and forsaken this generation that has provoked his fury.’\n\n“The people of Judah have sinned before my very eyes,” says the LORD. “They have set up their abominable idols right in the Temple that bears my name, defiling it. They have built pagan shrines at Topheth, the garbage dump in the valley of Ben-Hinnom, and there they burn their sons and daughters in the fire. I have never commanded such a horrible deed; it never even crossed my mind to command such a thing! So beware, for the time is coming,” says the LORD, “when that garbage dump will no longer be called Topheth or the valley of Ben-Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter. They will bury the bodies in Topheth until there is no more room for them. The bodies of my people will be food for the vultures and wild animals, and no one will be left to scare them away. I will put an end to the happy singing and laughter in the streets of Jerusalem. The joyful voices of bridegrooms and brides will no longer be heard in the towns of Judah. The land will lie in complete desolation.",

Who has been instructed by the LORD and can explain it to others? Why has the land been so ruined that no one dares to travel through it?\nThe LORD replies, “This has happened because my people have abandoned my instructions; they have refused to obey what I said. Instead, they have stubbornly followed their own desires and worshiped the images of Baal, as their ancestors taught them. So now, this is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: Look! I will feed them with bitterness and give them poison to drink. I will scatter them around the world, in places they and their ancestors never heard of, and even there I will chase them with the sword until I have destroyed them completely.”\n\nThis is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies says:\n“Consider all this, and call for the mourners.\nSend for the women who mourn at funerals.\nQuick! Begin your weeping!\nLet the tears flow from your eyes.\nHear the people of Jerusalem crying in despair,\n‘We are ruined! We are completely humiliated!\nWe must leave our land,\nbecause our homes have been torn down.’”\n\nListen, you women, to the words of the LORD;\nopen your ears to what he has to say.\nTeach your daughters to wail;\nteach one another how to lament.\nFor death has crept in through our windows\nand has entered our mansions.\nIt has killed off the flower of our youth:\nChildren no longer play in the streets,\nand young men no longer gather in the squares.\n\nThis is what the LORD says:\n“Bodies will be scattered across the fields like clumps of manure,\nlike bundles of grain after the harvest.\nNo one will be left to bury them.”\n\nThis is what the LORD says:\n“Don’t let the wise boast in their wisdom,\nor the powerful boast in their power,\nor the rich boast in their riches.\nBut those who wish to boast\nshould boast in this alone:\nthat they truly know me and understand that I am the LORD\nwho demonstrates unfailing love\nand who brings justice and righteousness to the earth,\nand that I delight in these things.\nI, the LORD, have spoken!\n\n“A time is coming,” says the LORD, “when I will punish all those who are circumcised in body but not in spirit— the Egyptians, Edomites, Ammonites, Moabites, the people who live in the desert in remote places, and yes, even the people of Judah. And like all these pagan nations, the people of Israel also have uncircumcised hearts.”",

Hear the terrifying roar of great armies\nas they roll down from the north.\nThe towns of Judah will be destroyed\nand become a haunt for jackals.\n\nI know, LORD, that our lives are not our own.\nWe are not able to plan our own course.\nSo correct me, LORD, but please be gentle.\nDo not correct me in anger, for I would die.\nPour out your wrath on the nations that refuse to acknowledge you—\non the peoples that do not call upon your name.\nFor they have devoured your people Israel;\nthey have devoured and consumed them,\nmaking the land a desolate wilderness.",

Say to them, ‘This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Cursed is anyone who does not obey the terms of my covenant! For I said to your ancestors when I brought them out of the iron-smelting furnace of Egypt, “If you obey me and do whatever I command you, then you will be my people, and I will be your God.” I said this so I could keep my promise to your ancestors to give you a land flowing with milk and honey—the land you live in today.’”\nThen I replied, “Amen, LORD! May it be so.”\nThen the LORD said, “Broadcast this message in the streets of Jerusalem. Go from town to town throughout the land and say, ‘Remember the ancient covenant, and do everything it requires. For I solemnly warned your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, “Obey me!” I have repeated this warning over and over to this day, but your ancestors did not listen or even pay attention. Instead, they stubbornly followed their own evil desires. And because they refused to obey, I brought upon them all the curses described in this covenant.’”\nAgain the LORD spoke to me and said, “I have discovered a conspiracy against me among the people of Judah and Jerusalem. They have returned to the sins of their ancestors. They have refused to listen to me and are worshiping other gods. Israel and Judah have both broken the covenant I made with their ancestors. Therefore, this is what the LORD says: I am going to bring calamity upon them, and they will not escape. Though they beg for mercy, I will not listen to their cries. Then the people of Judah and Jerusalem will pray to their idols and burn incense before them. But the idols will not save them when disaster strikes! Look now, people of Judah; you have as many gods as you have towns. You have as many altars of shame—altars for burning incense to your god Baal—as there are streets in Jerusalem.\n“Pray no more for these people, Jeremiah. Do not weep or pray for them, for I will not listen to them when they cry out to me in distress.\n\n“What right do my beloved people have to come to my Temple,\nwhen they have done so many immoral things?\nCan their vows and sacrifices prevent their destruction?\nThey actually rejoice in doing evil!\nI, the LORD, once called them a thriving olive tree,\nbeautiful to see and full of good fruit.\nBut now I have sent the fury of their enemies\nto burn them with fire,\nleaving them charred and broken.\n\n“I, the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, who planted this olive tree, have ordered it destroyed. For the people of Israel and Judah have done evil, arousing my anger by burning incense to Baal.”\n\nThen the LORD told me about the plots my enemies were making against me. I was like a lamb being led to the slaughter. I had no idea that they were planning to kill me! “Let’s destroy this man and all his words,” they said. “Let’s cut him down, so his name will be forgotten forever.”\n\nO LORD of Heaven’s Armies,\nyou make righteous judgments,\nand you examine the deepest thoughts and secrets.\nLet me see your vengeance against them,\nfor I have committed my cause to you.\n\nThis is what the LORD says about the men of Anathoth who wanted me dead. They had said, “We will kill you if you do not stop prophesying in the LORD’s name.” So this is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies says about them: “I will punish them! Their young men will die in battle, and their boys and girls will starve to death. Not one of these plotters from Anathoth will survive, for I will bring disaster upon them when their time of punishment comes.”",

Hide it there in a hole in the rocks.” So I went and hid it by the Euphrates as the LORD had instructed me.\nA long time afterward the LORD said to me, “Go back to the Euphrates and get the loincloth I told you to hide there.” So I went to the Euphrates and dug it out of the hole where I had hidden it. But now it was rotting and falling apart. The loincloth was good for nothing.\nThen I received this message from the LORD: “This is what the LORD says: This shows how I will rot away the pride of Judah and Jerusalem. These wicked people refuse to listen to me. They stubbornly follow their own desires and worship other gods. Therefore, they will become like this loincloth—good for nothing! As a loincloth clings to a man’s waist, so I created Judah and Israel to cling to me, says the LORD. They were to be my people, my pride, my glory—an honor to my name. But they would not listen to me.\n“So tell them, ‘This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: May all your jars be filled with wine.’ And they will reply, ‘Of course! Jars are made to be filled with wine!’\n“Then tell them, ‘No, this is what the LORD means: I will fill everyone in this land with drunkenness—from the king sitting on David’s throne to the priests and the prophets, right down to the common people of Jerusalem. I will smash them against each other, even parents against children, says the LORD. I will not let my pity or mercy or compassion keep me from destroying them.’”\n\nListen and pay attention!\nDo not be arrogant, for the LORD has spoken.\nGive glory to the LORD your God\nbefore it is too late.\nAcknowledge him before he brings darkness upon you,\ncausing you to stumble and fall on the darkening mountains.\nFor then, when you look for light,\nyou will find only terrible darkness and gloom.\nAnd if you still refuse to listen,\nI will weep alone because of your pride.\nMy eyes will overflow with tears,\nbecause the LORD’s flock will be led away into exile.\n\nSay to the king and his mother,\n“Come down from your thrones\nand sit in the dust,\nfor your glorious crowns\nwill soon be snatched from your heads.”\nThe towns of the Negev will close their gates,\nand no one will be able to open them.\nThe people of Judah will be taken away as captives.\nAll will be carried into exile.\n\nOpen up your eyes and see\nthe armies marching down from the north!\nWhere is your flock—\nyour beautiful flock—\nthat he gave you to care for?\nWhat will you say when the LORD takes the allies you have cultivated\nand appoints them as your rulers?\nPangs of anguish will grip you,\nlike those of a woman in labor!\nYou may ask yourself,\n“Why is all this happening to me?”\nIt is because of your many sins!\nThat is why you have been stripped\nand raped by invading armies.\nCan an Ethiopian change the color of his skin?\nCan a leopard take away its spots?\nNeither can you start doing good,\nfor you have always done evil.\n\n“I will scatter you like chaff\nthat is blown away by the desert winds.\nThis is your allotment,\nthe portion I have assigned to you,”\nsays the LORD,\n“for you have forgotten me,\nputting your trust in false gods.\nI myself will strip you\nand expose you to shame.\nI have seen your adultery and lust,\nand your disgusting idol worship out in the fields and on the hills.\nWhat sorrow awaits you, Jerusalem!\nHow long before you are pure?”",

When they fast, I will pay no attention. When they present their burnt offerings and grain offerings to me, I will not accept them. Instead, I will devour them with war, famine, and disease.”\nThen I said, “O Sovereign LORD, their prophets are telling them, ‘All is well—no war or famine will come. The LORD will surely send you peace.’”\nThen the LORD said, “These prophets are telling lies in my name. I did not send them or tell them to speak. I did not give them any messages. They prophesy of visions and revelations they have never seen or heard. They speak foolishness made up in their own lying hearts. Therefore, this is what the LORD says: I will punish these lying prophets, for they have spoken in my name even though I never sent them. They say that no war or famine will come, but they themselves will die by war and famine! As for the people to whom they prophesy—their bodies will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem, victims of famine and war. There will be no one left to bury them. Husbands, wives, sons, and daughters—all will be gone. For I will pour out their own wickedness on them. Now, Jeremiah, say this to them:\n\n“Night and day my eyes overflow with tears.\nI cannot stop weeping,\nfor my virgin daughter—my precious people—\nhas been struck down\nand lies mortally wounded.\nIf I go out into the fields,\nI see the bodies of people slaughtered by the enemy.\nIf I walk the city streets,\nI see people who have died of starvation.\nThe prophets and priests continue with their work,\nbut they don’t know what they’re doing.”\n\nLORD, have you completely rejected Judah?\nDo you really hate Jerusalem?\nWhy have you wounded us past all hope of healing?\nWe hoped for peace, but no peace came.\nWe hoped for a time of healing, but found only terror.\nLORD, we confess our wickedness\nand that of our ancestors, too.\nWe all have sinned against you.\nFor the sake of your reputation, LORD, do not abandon us.\nDo not disgrace your own glorious throne.\nPlease remember us,\nand do not break your covenant with us.\n\nCan any of the worthless foreign gods send us rain?\nDoes it fall from the sky by itself?\nNo, you are the one, O LORD our God!\nOnly you can do such things.\nSo we will wait for you to help us.",

Because of the wicked things Manasseh son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem, I will make my people an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.\n\n“Who will feel sorry for you, Jerusalem?\nWho will weep for you?\nWho will even bother to ask how you are?\nYou have abandoned me\nand turned your back on me,”\nsays the LORD.\n“Therefore, I will raise my fist to destroy you.\nI am tired of always giving you another chance.\nI will winnow you like grain at the gates of your cities\nand take away the children you hold dear.\nI will destroy my own people,\nbecause they refuse to change their evil ways.\nThere will be more widows\nthan the grains of sand on the seashore.\nAt noontime I will bring a destroyer\nagainst the mothers of young men.\nI will cause anguish and terror\nto come upon them suddenly.\nThe mother of seven grows faint and gasps for breath;\nher sun has gone down while it is still day.\nShe sits childless now,\ndisgraced and humiliated.\nAnd I will hand over those who are left\nto be killed by the enemy.\nI, the LORD, have spoken!”\n\nThen I said,\n\n“What sorrow is mine, my mother.\nOh, that I had died at birth!\nI am hated everywhere I go.\nI am neither a lender who threatens to foreclose\nnor a borrower who refuses to pay—\nyet they all curse me.”\n\nThe LORD replied,\n\n“I will take care of you, Jeremiah.\nYour enemies will ask you to plead on their behalf\nin times of trouble and distress.\nCan a man break a bar of iron from the north,\nor a bar of bronze?\nAt no cost to them,\nI will hand over your wealth and treasures\nas plunder to your enemies,\nfor sin runs rampant in your land.\nI will tell your enemies to take you\nas captives to a foreign land.\nFor my anger blazes like a fire\nthat will burn forever.”\n\nThen I said,\n\n“LORD, you know what’s happening to me.\nPlease step in and help me. Punish my persecutors!\nPlease give me time; don’t let me die young.\nIt’s for your sake that I am suffering.\nWhen I discovered your words, I devoured them.\nThey are my joy and my heart’s delight,\nfor I bear your name,\nO LORD God of Heaven’s Armies.\nI never joined the people in their merry feasts.\nI sat alone because your hand was on me.\nI was filled with indignation at their sins.\nWhy then does my suffering continue?\nWhy is my wound so incurable?\nYour help seems as uncertain as a seasonal brook,\nlike a spring that has gone dry.”\n\nThis is how the LORD responds:\n\n“If you return to me, I will restore you\nso you can continue to serve me.\nIf you speak good words rather than worthless ones,\nyou will be my spokesman.\nYou must influence them;\ndo not let them influence you!\nThey will fight against you like an attacking army,\nbut I will make you as secure as a fortified wall of bronze.\nThey will not conquer you,\nfor I am with you to protect and rescue you.\nI, the LORD, have spoken!\nYes, I will certainly keep you safe from these wicked men.\nI will rescue you from their cruel hands.”",

No one will mourn for them or bury them, and they will lie scattered on the ground like manure. They will die from war and famine, and their bodies will be food for the vultures and wild animals.”\n\nThis is what the LORD says: “Do not go to funerals to mourn and show sympathy for these people, for I have removed my protection and peace from them. I have taken away my unfailing love and my mercy. Both the great and the lowly will die in this land. No one will bury them or mourn for them. Their friends will not cut themselves in sorrow or shave their heads in sadness. No one will offer a meal to comfort those who mourn for the dead—not even at the death of a mother or father. No one will send a cup of wine to console them.\n“And do not go to their feasts and parties. Do not eat and drink with them at all. For this is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: In your own lifetime, before your very eyes, I will put an end to the happy singing and laughter in this land. The joyful voices of bridegrooms and brides will no longer be heard.\n“When you tell the people all these things, they will ask, ‘Why has the LORD decreed such terrible things against us? What have we done to deserve such treatment? What is our sin against the LORD our God?’\n“Then you will give them the LORD’s reply: ‘It is because your ancestors were unfaithful to me. They worshiped other gods and served them. They abandoned me and did not obey my word. And you are even worse than your ancestors! You stubbornly follow your own evil desires and refuse to listen to me. So I will throw you out of this land and send you into a foreign land where you and your ancestors have never been. There you can worship idols day and night—and I will grant you no favors!’\n\n“But the time is coming,” says the LORD, “when people who are taking an oath will no longer say, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who rescued the people of Israel from the land of Egypt.’ Instead, they will say, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the people of Israel back to their own land from the land of the north and from all the countries to which he had exiled them.’ For I will bring them back to this land that I gave their ancestors.\n“But now I am sending for many fishermen who will catch them,” says the LORD. “I am sending for hunters who will hunt them down in the mountains, hills, and caves. I am watching them closely, and I see every sin. They cannot hope to hide from me. I will double their punishment for all their sins, because they have defiled my land with lifeless images of their detestable gods and have filled my territory with their evil deeds.”\n\nLORD, you are my strength and fortress,\nmy refuge in the day of trouble!\nNations from around the world\nwill come to you and say,\n“Our ancestors left us a foolish heritage,\nfor they worshiped worthless idols.\nCan people make their own gods?\nThese are not real gods at all!”\n\nThe LORD says,\n“Now I will show them my power;\nnow I will show them my might.\nAt last they will know and understand\nthat I am the LORD.",

Say to all the people, ‘Listen to this message from the LORD, you kings of Judah and all you people of Judah and everyone living in Jerusalem. This is what the LORD says: Listen to my warning! Stop carrying on your trade at Jerusalem’s gates on the Sabbath day. Do not do your work on the Sabbath, but make it a holy day. I gave this command to your ancestors, but they did not listen or obey. They stubbornly refused to pay attention or accept my discipline.\n“‘But if you obey me, says the LORD, and do not carry on your trade at the gates or work on the Sabbath day, and if you keep it holy, then kings and their officials will go in and out of these gates forever. There will always be a descendant of David sitting on the throne here in Jerusalem. Kings and their officials will always ride in and out among the people of Judah in chariots and on horses, and this city will remain forever. And from all around Jerusalem, from the towns of Judah and Benjamin, from the western foothills and the hill country and the Negev, the people will come with their burnt offerings and sacrifices. They will bring their grain offerings, frankincense, and thanksgiving offerings to the LORD’s Temple.\n“‘But if you do not listen to me and refuse to keep the Sabbath holy, and if on the Sabbath day you bring loads of merchandise through the gates of Jerusalem just as on other days, then I will set fire to these gates. The fire will spread to the palaces, and no one will be able to put out the roaring flames.’”",

As the clay is in the potter’s hand, so are you in my hand. If I announce that a certain nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down, and destroyed, but then that nation renounces its evil ways, I will not destroy it as I had planned. And if I announce that I will plant and build up a certain nation or kingdom, but then that nation turns to evil and refuses to obey me, I will not bless it as I said I would.\n“Therefore, Jeremiah, go and warn all Judah and Jerusalem.

Say to them, ‘Listen to this message from the LORD, you kings of Judah and citizens of Jerusalem! This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: I will bring a terrible disaster on this place, and the ears of those who hear about it will ring!\n“‘For Israel has forsaken me and turned this valley into a place of wickedness. The people burn incense to foreign gods—idols never before acknowledged by this generation, by their ancestors, or by the kings of Judah. And they have filled this place with the blood of innocent children. They have built pagan shrines to Baal, and there they burn their sons as sacrifices to Baal. I have never commanded such a horrible deed; it never even crossed my mind to command such a thing! So beware, for the time is coming, says the LORD, when this garbage dump will no longer be called Topheth or the valley of Ben-Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter.\n“‘For I will upset the careful plans of Judah and Jerusalem. I will allow the people to be slaughtered by invading armies, and I will leave their dead bodies as food for the vultures and wild animals. I will reduce Jerusalem to ruins, making it a monument to their stupidity. All who pass by will be astonished and will gasp at the destruction they see there. I will see to it that your enemies lay siege to the city until all the food is gone. Then those trapped inside will eat their own sons and daughters and friends. They will be driven to utter despair.’\n“As these men watch you, Jeremiah, smash the jar you brought. Then say to them, ‘This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies says: As this jar lies shattered, so I will shatter the people of Judah and Jerusalem beyond all hope of repair. They will bury the bodies here in Topheth, the garbage dump, until there is no more room for them. This is what I will do to this place and its people, says the LORD. I will cause this city to become defiled like Topheth. Yes, all the houses in Jerusalem, including the palace of Judah’s kings, will become like Topheth—all the houses where you burned incense on the rooftops to your star gods, and where liquid offerings were poured out to your idols.’”\nThen Jeremiah returned from Topheth, the garbage dump where he had delivered this message, and he stopped in front of the Temple of the LORD. He said to the people there, “This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘I will bring disaster upon this city and its surrounding towns as I promised, because you have stubbornly refused to listen to me.’”",

Perhaps the LORD will be gracious and do a mighty miracle as he has done in the past. Perhaps he will force Nebuchadnezzar to withdraw his armies.”\nJeremiah replied, “Go back to King Zedekiah and tell him, ‘This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I will make your weapons useless against the king of Babylon and the Babylonians who are outside your walls attacking you. In fact, I will bring your enemies right into the heart of this city. I myself will fight against you with a strong hand and a powerful arm, for I am very angry. You have made me furious! I will send a terrible plague upon this city, and both people and animals will die. And after all that, says the LORD, I will hand over King Zedekiah, his staff, and everyone else in the city who survives the disease, war, and famine. I will hand them over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and to their other enemies. He will slaughter them and show them no mercy, pity, or compassion.’\n“Tell all the people, ‘This is what the LORD says: Take your choice of life or death! Everyone who stays in Jerusalem will die from war, famine, or disease, but those who go out and surrender to the Babylonians will live. Their reward will be life! For I have decided to bring disaster and not good upon this city, says the LORD. It will be handed over to the king of Babylon, and he will reduce it to ashes.’\n\n“Say to the royal family of Judah, ‘Listen to this message from the LORD! This is what the LORD says to the dynasty of David:\n\n“‘Give justice each morning to the people you judge!\nHelp those who have been robbed;\nrescue them from their oppressors.\nOtherwise, my anger will burn like an unquenchable fire\nbecause of all your sins.\nI will personally fight against the people in Jerusalem,\nthat mighty fortress—\nthe people who boast, “No one can touch us here.\nNo one can break in here.”\nAnd I myself will punish you for your sinfulness,\nsays the LORD.\nI will light a fire in your forests\nthat will burn up everything around you.’”",

Say to him, ‘Listen to this message from the LORD, you king of Judah, sitting on David’s throne. Let your attendants and your people listen, too. This is what the LORD says: Be fair-minded and just. Do what is right! Help those who have been robbed; rescue them from their oppressors. Quit your evil deeds! Do not mistreat foreigners, orphans, and widows. Stop murdering the innocent! If you obey me, there will always be a descendant of David sitting on the throne here in Jerusalem. The king will ride through the palace gates in chariots and on horses, with his parade of attendants and subjects. But if you refuse to pay attention to this warning, I swear by my own name, says the LORD, that this palace will become a pile of rubble.’”\n\nNow this is what the LORD says concerning Judah’s royal palace:\n\n“I love you as much as fruitful Gilead\nand the green forests of Lebanon.\nBut I will turn you into a desert,\nwith no one living within your walls.\nI will call for wreckers,\nwho will bring out their tools to dismantle you.\nThey will tear out all your fine cedar beams\nand throw them on the fire.\n\n“People from many nations will pass by the ruins of this city and say to one another, ‘Why did the LORD destroy such a great city?’ And the answer will be, ‘Because they violated their covenant with the LORD their God by worshiping other gods.’”\n\nDo not weep for the dead king or mourn his loss.\nInstead, weep for the captive king being led away!\nFor he will never return to see his native land again.\n\nFor this is what the LORD says about Jehoahaz, who succeeded his father, King Josiah, and was taken away as a captive: “He will never return. He will die in a distant land and will never again see his own country.”\n\nAnd the LORD says, “What sorrow awaits Jehoiakim,\nwho builds his palace with forced labor.\nHe builds injustice into its walls,\nfor he makes his neighbors work for nothing.\nHe does not pay them for their labor.\nHe says, ‘I will build a magnificent palace\nwith huge rooms and many windows.\nI will panel it throughout with fragrant cedar\nand paint it a lovely red.’\nBut a beautiful cedar palace does not make a great king!\nYour father, Josiah, also had plenty to eat and drink.\nBut he was just and right in all his dealings.\nThat is why God blessed him.\nHe gave justice and help to the poor and needy,\nand everything went well for him.\nIsn’t that what it means to know me?”\nsays the LORD.\n“But you! You have eyes only for greed and dishonesty!\nYou murder the innocent,\noppress the poor, and reign ruthlessly.”\n\nTherefore, this is what the LORD says about Jehoiakim, son of King Josiah:\n\n“The people will not mourn for him, crying to one another,\n‘Alas, my brother! Alas, my sister!’\nHis subjects will not mourn for him, crying,\n‘Alas, our master is dead! Alas, his splendor is gone!’\nHe will be buried like a dead donkey—\ndragged out of Jerusalem and dumped outside the gates!\nWeep for your allies in Lebanon.\nShout for them in Bashan.\nSearch for them in the regions east of the river.\nSee, they are all destroyed.\nNot one is left to help you.\nI warned you when you were prosperous,\nbut you replied, ‘Don’t bother me.’\nYou have been that way since childhood—\nyou simply will not obey me!\nAnd now the wind will blow away your allies.\nAll your friends will be taken away as captives.\nSurely then you will see your wickedness and be ashamed.\nIt may be nice to live in a beautiful palace\npaneled with wood from the cedars of Lebanon,\nbut soon you will groan with pangs of anguish—\nanguish like that of a woman in labor.\n\n“As surely as I live,” says the LORD, “I will abandon you, Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah. Even if you were the signet ring on my right hand, I would pull you off. I will hand you over to those who seek to kill you, those you so desperately fear—to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and the mighty Babylonian army. I will expel you and your mother from this land, and you will die in a foreign country, not in your native land. You will never again return to the land you yearn for.\n\n“Why is this man Jehoiachin like a discarded, broken jar?\nWhy are he and his children to be exiled to a foreign land?\nO earth, earth, earth!\nListen to this message from the LORD!\nThis is what the LORD says:\n‘Let the record show that this man Jehoiachin was childless.\nHe is a failure,\nfor none of his children will succeed him on the throne of David\nto rule over Judah.’",

Now I will pour out judgment on you for the evil you have done to them. But I will gather together the remnant of my flock from the countries where I have driven them. I will bring them back to their own sheepfold, and they will be fruitful and increase in number. Then I will appoint responsible shepherds who will care for them, and they will never be afraid again. Not a single one will be lost or missing. I, the LORD, have spoken!\n\n“For the time is coming,”\nsays the LORD,\n“when I will raise up a righteous descendant\nfrom King David’s line.\nHe will be a King who rules with wisdom.\nHe will do what is just and right throughout the land.\nAnd this will be his name:\n‘The LORD Is Our Righteousness.’\nIn that day Judah will be saved,\nand Israel will live in safety.\n\n“In that day,” says the LORD, “when people are taking an oath, they will no longer say, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who rescued the people of Israel from the land of Egypt.’ Instead, they will say, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the people of Israel back to their own land from the land of the north and from all the countries to which he had exiled them.’ Then they will live in their own land.”\n\nMy heart is broken because of the false prophets,\nand my bones tremble.\nI stagger like a drunkard,\nlike someone overcome by wine,\nbecause of the holy words\nthe LORD has spoken against them.\nFor the land is full of adultery,\nand it lies under a curse.\nThe land itself is in mourning—\nits wilderness pastures are dried up.\nFor they all do evil\nand abuse what power they have.\n\n“Even the priests and prophets\nare ungodly, wicked men.\nI have seen their despicable acts\nright here in my own Temple,”\nsays the LORD.\n“Therefore, the paths they take\nwill become slippery.\nThey will be chased through the dark,\nand there they will fall.\nFor I will bring disaster upon them\nat the time fixed for their punishment.\nI, the LORD, have spoken!\n\n“I saw that the prophets of Samaria were terribly evil,\nfor they prophesied in the name of Baal\nand led my people of Israel into sin.\nBut now I see that the prophets of Jerusalem are even worse!\nThey commit adultery and love dishonesty.\nThey encourage those who are doing evil\nso that no one turns away from their sins.\nThese prophets are as wicked\nas the people of Sodom and Gomorrah once were.”\n\nTherefore, this is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies says concerning the prophets:\n\n“I will feed them with bitterness\nand give them poison to drink.\nFor it is because of Jerusalem’s prophets\nthat wickedness has filled this land.”\n\nThis is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies says to his people:\n\n“Do not listen to these prophets when they prophesy to you,\nfilling you with futile hopes.\nThey are making up everything they say.\nThey do not speak for the LORD!\nThey keep saying to those who despise my word,\n‘Don’t worry! The LORD says you will have peace!’\nAnd to those who stubbornly follow their own desires,\nthey say, ‘No harm will come your way!’\n\n“Have any of these prophets been in the LORD’s presence\nto hear what he is really saying?\nHas even one of them cared enough to listen?\nLook! The LORD’s anger bursts out like a storm,\na whirlwind that swirls down on the heads of the wicked.\nThe anger of the LORD will not diminish\nuntil it has finished all he has planned.\nIn the days to come\nyou will understand all this very clearly.\n\n“I have not sent these prophets,\nyet they run around claiming to speak for me.\nI have given them no message,\nyet they go on prophesying.\nIf they had stood before me and listened to me,\nthey would have spoken my words,\nand they would have turned my people\nfrom their evil ways and deeds.\nAm I a God who is only close at hand?” says the LORD.\n“No, I am far away at the same time.\nCan anyone hide from me in a secret place?\nAm I not everywhere in all the heavens and earth?”\nsays the LORD.\n\n“I have heard these prophets say, ‘Listen to the dream I had from God last night.’ And then they proceed to tell lies in my name. How long will this go on? If they are prophets, they are prophets of deceit, inventing everything they say. By telling these false dreams, they are trying to get my people to forget me, just as their ancestors did by worshiping the idols of Baal.\n\n“Let these false prophets tell their dreams,\nbut let my true messengers faithfully proclaim my every word.\nThere is a difference between straw and grain!\nDoes not my word burn like fire?”\nsays the LORD.\n“Is it not like a mighty hammer\nthat smashes a rock to pieces?\n\n“Therefore,” says the LORD, “I am against these prophets who steal messages from each other and claim they are from me. I am against these smooth-tongued prophets who say, ‘This prophecy is from the LORD!’ I am against these false prophets. Their imaginary dreams are flagrant lies that lead my people into sin. I did not send or appoint them, and they have no message at all for my people. I, the LORD, have spoken!\n\n“Suppose one of the people or one of the prophets or priests asks you, ‘What prophecy has the LORD burdened you with now?’ You must reply, ‘You are the burden! The LORD says he will abandon you!’\n“If any prophet, priest, or anyone else says, ‘I have a prophecy from the LORD,’ I will punish that person along with his entire family. You should keep asking each other, ‘What is the LORD’s answer?’ or ‘What is the LORD saying?’ But stop using this phrase, ‘prophecy from the LORD.’ For people are using it to give authority to their own ideas, turning upside down the words of our God, the living God, the LORD of Heaven’s Armies.\n“This is what you should say to the prophets: ‘What is the LORD’s answer?’ or ‘What is the LORD saying?’ But suppose they respond, ‘This is a prophecy from the LORD!’ Then you should say, ‘This is what the LORD says: Because you have used this phrase, “prophecy from the LORD,” even though I warned you not to use it, I will forget you completely. I will expel you from my presence, along with this city that I gave to you and your ancestors. And I will make you an object of ridicule, and your name will be infamous throughout the ages.’”",

      "chapter_text": "This message for all the people of Judah came to Jeremiah from the LORD during the fourth year of Jehoiakim’s reign over Judah. This was the year when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon began his reign.\nJeremiah the prophet said to all the people in Judah and Jerusalem, “For the past twenty-three years—from the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah, until now—the LORD has been giving me his messages. I have faithfully passed them on to you, but you have not listened.\n“Again and again the LORD has sent you his servants, the prophets, but you have not listened or even paid attention. Each time the message was this: ‘Turn from the evil road you are traveling and from the evil things you are doing. Only then will I let you live in this land that the LORD gave to you and your ancestors forever. Do not provoke my anger by worshiping idols you made with your own hands. Then I will not harm you.’\n“But you would not listen to me,” says the LORD. “You made me furious by worshiping idols you made with your own hands, bringing on yourselves all the disasters you now suffer. And now the LORD of Heaven’s Armies says: Because you have not listened to me, I will gather together all the armies of the north under King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, whom I have appointed as my deputy. I will bring them all against this land and its people and against the surrounding nations. I will completely destroy you and make you an object of horror and contempt and a ruin forever. I will take away your happy singing and laughter. The joyful voices of bridegrooms and brides will no longer be heard. Your millstones will fall silent, and the lights in your homes will go out. This entire land will become a desolate wasteland. Israel and her neighboring lands will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.\n“Then, after the seventy years of captivity are over, I will punish the king of Babylon and his people for their sins,” says the LORD. “I will make the country of the Babylonians a wasteland forever. I will bring upon them all the terrors I have promised in this book—all the penalties announced by Jeremiah against the nations. Many nations and great kings will enslave the Babylonians, just as they enslaved my people. I will punish them in proportion to the suffering they cause my people.”\nLORD\nThis is what the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me: “Take from my hand this cup filled to the brim with my anger, and make all the nations to whom I send you drink from it. When they drink from it, they will stagger, crazed by the warfare I will send against them.”\nSo I took the cup of anger from the LORD and made all the nations drink from it—every nation to which the LORD sent me. I went to Jerusalem and the other towns of Judah, and their kings and officials drank from the cup. From that day until this, they have been a desolate ruin, an object of horror, contempt, and cursing. I gave the cup to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, his attendants, his officials, and all his people, along with all the foreigners living in that land. I also gave it to all the kings of the land of Uz and the kings of the Philistine cities of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and what remains of Ashdod. Then I gave the cup to the nations of Edom, Moab, and Ammon, and the kings of Tyre and Sidon, and the kings of the regions across the sea. I gave it to Dedan, Tema, and Buz, and to the people who live in distant places. I gave it to the kings of Arabia, the kings of the nomadic tribes of the desert, and to the kings of Zimri, Elam, and Media. And I gave it to the kings of the northern countries, far and near, one after the other—all the kingdoms of the world. And finally, the king of Babylon himself drank from the cup of the LORD’s anger.\nThen the LORD said to me, “Now tell them, ‘This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: Drink from this cup of my anger. Get drunk and vomit; fall to rise no more, for I am sending terrible wars against you.’ And if they refuse to accept the cup, tell them, ‘The LORD of Heaven’s Armies says: You have no choice but to drink from it. I have begun to punish Jerusalem, the city that bears my name. Now should I let you go unpunished? No, you will not escape disaster. I will call for war against all the nations of the earth. I, the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, have spoken!’\n“Now prophesy all these things, and say to them,\n\n“‘The LORD will roar against his own land\nfrom his holy dwelling in heaven.\nHe will shout like those who tread grapes;\nhe will shout against everyone on earth.\nHis cry of judgment will reach the ends of the earth,\nfor the LORD will bring his case against all the nations.\nHe will judge all the people of the earth,\nslaughtering the wicked with the sword.\nI, the LORD, have spoken!’”\n\nThis is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies says:\n“Look! Disaster will fall upon nation after nation!\nA great whirlwind of fury is rising\nfrom the most distant corners of the earth!”\n\nIn that day those the LORD has slaughtered will fill the earth from one end to the other. No one will mourn for them or gather up their bodies to bury them. They will be scattered on the ground like manure.\n\nWeep and moan, you evil shepherds!\nRoll in the dust, you leaders of the flock!\nThe time of your slaughter has arrived;\nyou will fall and shatter like a fragile vase.\nYou will find no place to hide;\nthere will be no way to escape.\nListen to the frantic cries of the shepherds.\nThe leaders of the flock are wailing in despair,\nfor the LORD is ruining their pastures.\nPeaceful meadows will be turned into a wasteland\nby the LORD’s fierce anger.\nHe has left his den like a strong lion seeking its prey,\nand their land will be made desolate\nby the sword of the enemy\nand the LORD’s fierce anger.",

Then I will change my mind about the disaster I am ready to pour out on them because of their sins.\n“Say to them, ‘This is what the LORD says: If you will not listen to me and obey my word I have given you, and if you will not listen to my servants, the prophets—for I sent them again and again to warn you, but you would not listen to them— then I will destroy this Temple as I destroyed Shiloh, the place where the Tabernacle was located. And I will make Jerusalem an object of cursing in every nation on earth.’”\nThe priests, the prophets, and all the people listened to Jeremiah as he spoke in front of the LORD’s Temple. But when Jeremiah had finished his message, saying everything the LORD had told him to say, the priests and prophets and all the people at the Temple mobbed him. “Kill him!” they shouted. “What right do you have to prophesy in the LORD’s name that this Temple will be destroyed like Shiloh? What do you mean, saying that Jerusalem will be destroyed and left with no inhabitants?” And all the people threatened him as he stood in front of the Temple.\nWhen the officials of Judah heard what was happening, they rushed over from the palace and sat down at the New Gate of the Temple to hold court. The priests and prophets presented their accusations to the officials and the people. “This man should die!” they said. “You have heard with your own ears what a traitor he is, for he has prophesied against this city.”\nThen Jeremiah spoke to the officials and the people in his own defense. “The LORD sent me to prophesy against this Temple and this city,” he said. “The LORD gave me every word that I have spoken. But if you stop your sinning and begin to obey the LORD your God, he will change his mind about this disaster that he has announced against you. As for me, I am in your hands—do with me as you think best. But if you kill me, rest assured that you will be killing an innocent man! The responsibility for such a deed will lie on you, on this city, and on every person living in it. For it is absolutely true that the LORD sent me to speak every word you have heard.”\nThen the officials and the people said to the priests and prophets, “This man does not deserve the death sentence, for he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.”\nThen some of the wise old men stood and spoke to all the people assembled there. They said, “Remember when Micah of Moresheth prophesied during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah. He told the people of Judah,\n\n‘This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies says:\nMount Zion will be plowed like an open field;\nJerusalem will be reduced to ruins!\nA thicket will grow on the heights\nwhere the Temple now stands.’\n\nBut did King Hezekiah and the people kill him for saying this? No, they turned from their sins and worshiped the LORD. They begged him for mercy. Then the LORD changed his mind about the terrible disaster he had pronounced against them. So we are about to do ourselves great harm.”\nAt this time Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim was also prophesying for the LORD. And he predicted the same terrible disaster against the city and nation as Jeremiah did. When King Jehoiakim and the army officers and officials heard what he was saying, the king sent someone to kill him. But Uriah heard about the plan and escaped in fear to Egypt. Then King Jehoiakim sent Elnathan son of Acbor to Egypt along with several other men to capture Uriah. They took him prisoner and brought him back to King Jehoiakim. The king then killed Uriah with a sword and had him buried in an unmarked grave.\nNevertheless, Ahikam son of Shaphan stood up for Jeremiah and persuaded the court not to turn him over to the mob to be killed.",

Then send messages to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon through their ambassadors who have come to see King Zedekiah in Jerusalem. Give them this message for their masters: ‘This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: With my great strength and powerful arm I made the earth and all its people and every animal. I can give these things of mine to anyone I choose. Now I will give your countries to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who is my servant. I have put everything, even the wild animals, under his control. All the nations will serve him, his son, and his grandson until his time is up. Then many nations and great kings will conquer and rule over Babylon. So you must submit to Babylon’s king and serve him; put your neck under Babylon’s yoke! I will punish any nation that refuses to be his slave, says the LORD. I will send war, famine, and disease upon that nation until Babylon has conquered it.\n“‘Do not listen to your false prophets, fortune-tellers, interpreters of dreams, mediums, and sorcerers who say, “The king of Babylon will not conquer you.” They are all liars, and their lies will lead to your being driven out of your land. I will drive you out and send you far away to die. But the people of any nation that submits to the king of Babylon will be allowed to stay in their own country to farm the land as usual. I, the LORD, have spoken!’”\nThen I repeated this same message to King Zedekiah of Judah. “If you want to live, submit to the yoke of the king of Babylon and his people. Why do you insist on dying—you and your people? Why should you choose war, famine, and disease, which the LORD will bring against every nation that refuses to submit to Babylon’s king? Do not listen to the false prophets who keep telling you, ‘The king of Babylon will not conquer you.’ They are liars. This is what the LORD says: ‘I have not sent these prophets! They are telling you lies in my name, so I will drive you from this land. You will all die—you and all these prophets, too.’”\nThen I spoke to the priests and the people and said, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Do not listen to your prophets who claim that soon the gold articles taken from my Temple will be returned from Babylon. It is all a lie! Do not listen to them. Surrender to the king of Babylon, and you will live. Why should this whole city be destroyed? If they really are prophets and speak the LORD’s messages, let them pray to the LORD of Heaven’s Armies. Let them pray that the articles remaining in the LORD’s Temple and in the king’s palace and in the palaces of Jerusalem will not be carried away to Babylon!’\n“For the LORD of Heaven’s Armies has spoken about the pillars in front of the Temple, the great bronze basin called the Sea, the water carts, and all the other ceremonial articles. King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon left them here when he exiled Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, to Babylon, along with all the other nobles of Judah and Jerusalem. Yes, this is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says about the precious things still in the Temple, in the palace of Judah’s king, and in Jerusalem: ‘They will all be carried away to Babylon and will stay there until I send for them,’ says the LORD. ‘Then I will bring them back to Jerusalem again.’”",

He said, “This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘I will remove the yoke of the king of Babylon from your necks. Within two years I will bring back all the Temple treasures that King Nebuchadnezzar carried off to Babylon. And I will bring back Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the other captives that were taken to Babylon. I will surely break the yoke that the king of Babylon has put on your necks. I, the LORD, have spoken!’”\nJeremiah responded to Hananiah as they stood in front of all the priests and people at the Temple. He said, “Amen! May your prophecies come true! I hope the LORD does everything you say. I hope he does bring back from Babylon the treasures of this Temple and all the captives. But listen now to the solemn words I speak to you in the presence of all these people. The ancient prophets who preceded you and me spoke against many nations, always warning of war, disaster, and disease. So a prophet who predicts peace must show he is right. Only when his predictions come true can we know that he is really from the LORD.”\nThen Hananiah the prophet took the yoke off Jeremiah’s neck and broke it in pieces. And Hananiah said again to the crowd that had gathered, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Just as this yoke has been broken, within two years I will break the yoke of oppression from all the nations now subject to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.’” With that, Jeremiah left the Temple area.\nSoon after this confrontation with Hananiah, the LORD gave this message to Jeremiah: “Go and tell Hananiah, ‘This is what the LORD says: You have broken a wooden yoke, but you have replaced it with a yoke of iron. The LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: I have put a yoke of iron on the necks of all these nations, forcing them into slavery under King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. I have put everything, even the wild animals, under his control.’”\nThen Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah, “Listen, Hananiah! The LORD has not sent you, but the people believe your lies. Therefore, this is what the LORD says: ‘You must die. Your life will end this very year because you have rebelled against the LORD.’”\nTwo months later the prophet Hananiah died.",

      "chapter_text": "Jeremiah wrote a letter from Jerusalem to the elders, priests, prophets, and all the people who had been exiled to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar. This was after King Jehoiachin, the queen mother, the court officials, the other officials of Judah, and all the craftsmen and artisans had been deported from Jerusalem. He sent the letter with Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah when they went to Babylon as King Zedekiah’s ambassadors to Nebuchadnezzar. This is what Jeremiah’s letter said:\n\nThis is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says to all the captives he has exiled to Babylon from Jerusalem: “Build homes, and plan to stay. Plant gardens, and eat the food they produce. Marry and have children. Then find spouses for them so that you may have many grandchildren. Multiply! Do not dwindle away! And work for the peace and prosperity of the city where I sent you into exile. Pray to the LORD for it, for its welfare will determine your welfare.”\nThis is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: “Do not let your prophets and fortune-tellers who are with you in the land of Babylon trick you. Do not listen to their dreams, because they are telling you lies in my name. I have not sent them,” says the LORD.\nThis is what the LORD says: “You will be in Babylon for seventy years. But then I will come and do for you all the good things I have promised, and I will bring you home again. For I know the plans I have for you,” says the LORD. “They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope. In those days when you pray, I will listen. If you look for me wholeheartedly, you will find me. I will be found by you,” says the LORD. “I will end your captivity and restore your fortunes. I will gather you out of the nations where I sent you and will bring you home again to your own land.”\nYou claim that the LORD has raised up prophets for you in Babylon. But this is what the LORD says about the king who sits on David’s throne and all those still living here in Jerusalem—your relatives who were not exiled to Babylon. This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies says: “I will send war, famine, and disease upon them and make them like bad figs, too rotten to eat. Yes, I will pursue them with war, famine, and disease, and I will scatter them around the world. In every nation where I send them, I will make them an object of damnation, horror, contempt, and mockery. For they refuse to listen to me, though I have spoken to them repeatedly through the prophets I sent. And you who are in exile have not listened either,” says the LORD.\nTherefore, listen to this message from the LORD, all you captives there in Babylon. This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says about your prophets—Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah—who are telling you lies in my name: “I will turn them over to Nebuchadnezzar for execution before your eyes. Their terrible fate will become proverbial, so that the Judean exiles will curse someone by saying, ‘May the LORD make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon burned alive!’ For these men have done terrible things among my people. They have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives and have lied in my name, saying things I did not command. I am a witness to this. I, the LORD, have spoken.”\n\nThe LORD sent this message to Shemaiah the Nehelamite in Babylon: “This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: You wrote a letter on your own authority to Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, the priest, and you sent copies to the other priests and people in Jerusalem. You wrote to Zephaniah,\n\n“The LORD has appointed you to replace Jehoiada as the priest in charge of the house of the LORD. You are responsible to put into stocks and neck irons any crazy man who claims to be a prophet. So why have you done nothing to stop Jeremiah from Anathoth, who pretends to be a prophet among you? Jeremiah sent a letter here to Babylon, predicting that our captivity will be a long one. He said, ‘Build homes, and plan to stay. Plant gardens, and eat the food they produce.’”\n\nBut when Zephaniah the priest received Shemaiah’s letter, he took it to Jeremiah and read it to him. Then the LORD gave this message to Jeremiah: “Send an open letter to all the exiles in Babylon. Tell them, ‘This is what the LORD says concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Since he has prophesied to you when I did not send him and has tricked you into believing his lies, I will punish him and his family. None of his descendants will see the good things I will do for my people, for he has incited you to rebel against me. I, the LORD, have spoken!’”",

For the time is coming when I will restore the fortunes of my people of Israel and Judah. I will bring them home to this land that I gave to their ancestors, and they will possess it again. I, the LORD, have spoken!”\nThis is the message the LORD gave concerning Israel and Judah. This is what the LORD says:\n\n“I hear cries of fear;\nthere is terror and no peace.\nNow let me ask you a question:\nDo men give birth to babies?\nThen why do they stand there, ashen-faced,\nhands pressed against their sides\nlike a woman in labor?\nIn all history there has never been such a time of terror.\nIt will be a time of trouble for my people Israel.\nYet in the end they will be saved!\nFor in that day,”\nsays the LORD of Heaven’s Armies,\n“I will break the yoke from their necks\nand snap their chains.\nForeigners will no longer be their masters.\nFor my people will serve the LORD their God\nand their king descended from David—\nthe king I will raise up for them.\n\n“So do not be afraid, Jacob, my servant;\ndo not be dismayed, Israel,”\nsays the LORD.\n“For I will bring you home again from distant lands,\nand your children will return from their exile.\nIsrael will return to a life of peace and quiet,\nand no one will terrorize them.\nFor I am with you and will save you,”\nsays the LORD.\n“I will completely destroy the nations where I have scattered you,\nbut I will not completely destroy you.\nI will discipline you, but with justice;\nI cannot let you go unpunished.”\n\nThis is what the LORD says:\n“Your injury is incurable—\na terrible wound.\nThere is no one to help you\nor to bind up your injury.\nNo medicine can heal you.\nAll your lovers—your allies—have left you\nand do not care about you anymore.\nI have wounded you cruelly,\nas though I were your enemy.\nFor your sins are many,\nand your guilt is great.\nWhy do you protest your punishment—\nthis wound that has no cure?\nI have had to punish you\nbecause your sins are many\nand your guilt is great.\n\n“But all who devour you will be devoured,\nand all your enemies will be sent into exile.\nAll who plunder you will be plundered,\nand all who attack you will be attacked.\nI will give you back your health\nand heal your wounds,” says the LORD.\n“For you are called an outcast—\n‘Jerusalem for whom no one cares.’”\n\nThis is what the LORD says:\n“When I bring Israel home again from captivity\nand restore their fortunes,\nJerusalem will be rebuilt on its ruins,\nand the palace reconstructed as before.\nThere will be joy and songs of thanksgiving,\nand I will multiply my people, not diminish them;\nI will honor them, not despise them.\nTheir children will prosper as they did long ago.\nI will establish them as a nation before me,\nand I will punish anyone who hurts them.\nThey will have their own ruler again,\nand he will come from their own people.\nI will invite him to approach me,” says the LORD,\n“for who would dare to come unless invited?\nYou will be my people,\nand I will be your God.”\n\nLook! The LORD’s anger bursts out like a storm,\na driving wind that swirls down on the heads of the wicked.\nThe fierce anger of the LORD will not diminish\nuntil it has finished all he has planned.\nIn the days to come\nyou will understand all this.",

This is what the LORD says:\n\n“Those who survive the coming destruction\nwill find blessings even in the barren land,\nfor I will give rest to the people of Israel.”\n\nLong ago the LORD said to Israel:\n“I have loved you, my people, with an everlasting love.\nWith unfailing love I have drawn you to myself.\nI will rebuild you, my virgin Israel.\nYou will again be happy\nand dance merrily with your tambourines.\nAgain you will plant your vineyards on the mountains of Samaria\nand eat from your own gardens there.\nThe day will come when watchmen will shout\nfrom the hill country of Ephraim,\n‘Come, let us go up to Jerusalem\nto worship the LORD our God.’”\n\nNow this is what the LORD says:\n“Sing with joy for Israel.\nShout for the greatest of nations!\nShout out with praise and joy:\n‘Save your people, O LORD,\nthe remnant of Israel!’\nFor I will bring them from the north\nand from the distant corners of the earth.\nI will not forget the blind and lame,\nthe expectant mothers and women in labor.\nA great company will return!\nTears of joy will stream down their faces,\nand I will lead them home with great care.\nThey will walk beside quiet streams\nand on smooth paths where they will not stumble.\nFor I am Israel’s father,\nand Ephraim is my oldest child.\n\n“Listen to this message from the LORD,\nyou nations of the world;\nproclaim it in distant coastlands:\nThe LORD, who scattered his people,\nwill gather them and watch over them\nas a shepherd does his flock.\nFor the LORD has redeemed Israel\nfrom those too strong for them.\nThey will come home and sing songs of joy on the heights of Jerusalem.\nThey will be radiant because of the LORD’s good gifts—\nthe abundant crops of grain, new wine, and olive oil,\nand the healthy flocks and herds.\nTheir life will be like a watered garden,\nand all their sorrows will be gone.\nThe young women will dance for joy,\nand the men—old and young—will join in the celebration.\nI will turn their mourning into joy.\nI will comfort them and exchange their sorrow for rejoicing.\nThe priests will enjoy abundance,\nand my people will feast on my good gifts.\nI, the LORD, have spoken!”\n\nThis is what the LORD says:\n\n“A cry is heard in Ramah—\ndeep anguish and bitter weeping.\nRachel weeps for her children,\nrefusing to be comforted—\nfor her children are gone.”\n\nBut now this is what the LORD says:\n“Do not weep any longer,\nfor I will reward you,” says the LORD.\n“Your children will come back to you\nfrom the distant land of the enemy.\nThere is hope for your future,” says the LORD.\n“Your children will come again to their own land.\nI have heard Israel saying,\n‘You disciplined me severely,\nlike a calf that needs training for the yoke.\nTurn me again to you and restore me,\nfor you alone are the LORD my God.\nI turned away from God,\nbut then I was sorry.\nI kicked myself for my stupidity!\nI was thoroughly ashamed of all I did in my younger days.’\n\n“Is not Israel still my son,\nmy darling child?” says the LORD.\n“I often have to punish him,\nbut I still love him.\nThat’s why I long for him\nand surely will have mercy on him.\nSet up road signs;\nput up guideposts.\nMark well the path\nby which you came.\nCome back again, my virgin Israel;\nreturn to your towns here.\nHow long will you wander,\nmy wayward daughter?\nFor the LORD will cause something new to happen—\nIsrael will embrace her God.”\n\nThis is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: “When I bring them back from captivity, the people of Judah and its towns will again say, ‘The LORD bless you, O righteous home, O holy mountain!’ Townspeople and farmers and shepherds alike will live together in peace and happiness. For I have given rest to the weary and joy to the sorrowing.”\nAt this, I woke up and looked around. My sleep had been very sweet.\n“The day is coming,” says the LORD, “when I will greatly increase the human population and the number of animals here in Israel and Judah. In the past I deliberately uprooted and tore down this nation. I overthrew it, destroyed it, and brought disaster upon it. But in the future I will just as deliberately plant it and build it up. I, the LORD, have spoken!\n“The people will no longer quote this proverb:\n\n‘The parents have eaten sour grapes,\nbut their children’s mouths pucker at the taste.’\n\nAll people will die for their own sins—those who eat the sour grapes will be the ones whose mouths will pucker.\n“The day is coming,” says the LORD, “when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and Judah. This covenant will not be like the one I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand and brought them out of the land of Egypt. They broke that covenant, though I loved them as a husband loves his wife,” says the LORD.\n“But this is the new covenant I will make with the people of Israel after those days,” says the LORD. “I will put my instructions deep within them, and I will write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. And they will not need to teach their neighbors, nor will they need to teach their relatives, saying, ‘You should know the LORD.’ For everyone, from the least to the greatest, will know me already,” says the LORD. “And I will forgive their wickedness, and I will never again remember their sins.”\n\nIt is the LORD who provides the sun to light the day\nand the moon and stars to light the night,\nand who stirs the sea into roaring waves.\nHis name is the LORD of Heaven’s Armies,\nand this is what he says:\n“I am as likely to reject my people Israel\nas I am to abolish the laws of nature!”\nThis is what the LORD says:\n“Just as the heavens cannot be measured\nand the foundations of the earth cannot be explored,\nso I will not consider casting them away\nfor the evil they have done.\nI, the LORD, have spoken!\n\n“The day is coming,” says the LORD, “when all Jerusalem will be rebuilt for me, from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. A measuring line will be stretched out over the hill of Gareb and across to Goah. And the entire area—including the graveyard and ash dump in the valley, and all the fields out to the Kidron Valley on the east as far as the Horse Gate—will be holy to the LORD. The city will never again be captured or destroyed.”",

      "chapter_text": "The following message came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah. This was also the eighteenth year of the reign of King Nebuchadnezzar. Jerusalem was then under siege from the Babylonian army, and Jeremiah was imprisoned in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace. King Zedekiah had put him there, asking why he kept giving this prophecy: “This is what the LORD says: ‘I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will take it. King Zedekiah will be captured by the Babylonians and taken to meet the king of Babylon face to face. He will take Zedekiah to Babylon, and I will deal with him there,’ says the LORD. ‘If you fight against the Babylonians, you will never succeed.’”\nAt that time the LORD sent me a message. He said, “Your cousin Hanamel son of Shallum will come and say to you, ‘Buy my field at Anathoth. By law you have the right to buy it before it is offered to anyone else.’”\nThen, just as the LORD had said he would, my cousin Hanamel came and visited me in the prison. He said, “Please buy my field at Anathoth in the land of Benjamin. By law you have the right to buy it before it is offered to anyone else, so buy it for yourself.” Then I knew that the message I had heard was from the LORD.\nSo I bought the field at Anathoth, paying Hanamel seventeen pieces of silver for it. I signed and sealed the deed of purchase before witnesses, weighed out the silver, and paid him. Then I took the sealed deed and an unsealed copy of the deed, which contained the terms and conditions of the purchase, and I handed them to Baruch son of Neriah and grandson of Mahseiah. I did all this in the presence of my cousin Hanamel, the witnesses who had signed the deed, and all the men of Judah who were there in the courtyard of the guardhouse.\nThen I said to Baruch as they all listened, “This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Take both this sealed deed and the unsealed copy, and put them into a pottery jar to preserve them for a long time.’ For this is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Someday people will again own property here in this land and will buy and sell houses and vineyards and fields.’”\n\nThen after I had given the papers to Baruch, I prayed to the LORD:\n\n“O Sovereign LORD! You made the heavens and earth by your strong hand and powerful arm. Nothing is too hard for you! You show unfailing love to thousands, but you also bring the consequences of one generation’s sin upon the next. You are the great and powerful God, the LORD of Heaven’s Armies. You have all wisdom and do great and mighty miracles. You see the conduct of all people, and you give them what they deserve. You performed miraculous signs and wonders in the land of Egypt—things still remembered to this day! And you have continued to do great miracles in Israel and all around the world. You have made your name famous to this day.\n“You brought Israel out of Egypt with mighty signs and wonders, with a strong hand and powerful arm, and with overwhelming terror. You gave the people of Israel this land that you had promised their ancestors long before—a land flowing with milk and honey. Our ancestors came and conquered it and lived in it, but they refused to obey you or follow your word. They have not done anything you commanded. That is why you have sent this terrible disaster upon them.\n“See how the siege ramps have been built against the city walls! Through war, famine, and disease, the city will be handed over to the Babylonians, who will conquer it. Everything has happened just as you said. And yet, O Sovereign LORD, you have told me to buy the field—paying good money for it before these witnesses—even though the city will soon be handed over to the Babylonians.”\n\nThen this message came to Jeremiah from the LORD: “I am the LORD, the God of all the peoples of the world. Is anything too hard for me? Therefore, this is what the LORD says: I will hand this city over to the Babylonians and to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and he will capture it. The Babylonians outside the walls will come in and set fire to the city. They will burn down all these houses where the people provoked my anger by burning incense to Baal on the rooftops and by pouring out liquid offerings to other gods. Israel and Judah have done nothing but wrong since their earliest days. They have infuriated me with all their evil deeds,” says the LORD. “From the time this city was built until now, it has done nothing but anger me, so I am determined to get rid of it.\n“The sins of Israel and Judah—the sins of the people of Jerusalem, the kings, the officials, the priests, and the prophets—have stirred up my anger. My people have turned their backs on me and have refused to return. Even though I diligently taught them, they would not receive instruction or obey. They have set up their abominable idols right in my own Temple, defiling it. They have built pagan shrines to Baal in the valley of Ben-Hinnom, and there they sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molech. I have never commanded such a horrible deed; it never even crossed my mind to command such a thing. What an incredible evil, causing Judah to sin so greatly!\n\n“Now I want to say something more about this city. You have been saying, ‘It will fall to the king of Babylon through war, famine, and disease.’ But this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I will certainly bring my people back again from all the countries where I will scatter them in my fury. I will bring them back to this very city and let them live in peace and safety. They will be my people, and I will be their God. And I will give them one heart and one purpose: to worship me forever, for their own good and for the good of all their descendants. And I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never stop doing good for them. I will put a desire in their hearts to worship me, and they will never leave me. I will find joy doing good for them and will faithfully and wholeheartedly replant them in this land.\n“This is what the LORD says: Just as I have brought all these calamities on them, so I will do all the good I have promised them. Fields will again be bought and sold in this land about which you now say, ‘It has been ravaged by the Babylonians, a desolate land where people and animals have all disappeared.’ Yes, fields will once again be bought and sold—deeds signed and sealed and witnessed—in the land of Benjamin and here in Jerusalem, in the towns of Judah and in the hill country, in the foothills of Judah and in the Negev, too. For someday I will restore prosperity to them. I, the LORD, have spoken!”",

For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: You have torn down the houses of this city and even the king’s palace to get materials to strengthen the walls against the siege ramps and swords of the enemy. You expect to fight the Babylonians, but the men of this city are already as good as dead, for I have determined to destroy them in my terrible anger. I have abandoned them because of all their wickedness.\n“Nevertheless, the time will come when I will heal Jerusalem’s wounds and give it prosperity and true peace. I will restore the fortunes of Judah and Israel and rebuild their towns. I will cleanse them of their sins against me and forgive all their sins of rebellion. Then this city will bring me joy, glory, and honor before all the nations of the earth! The people of the world will see all the good I do for my people, and they will tremble with awe at the peace and prosperity I provide for them.\n“This is what the LORD says: You have said, ‘This is a desolate land where people and animals have all disappeared.’ Yet in the empty streets of Jerusalem and Judah’s other towns, there will be heard once more the sounds of joy and laughter. The joyful voices of bridegrooms and brides will be heard again, along with the joyous songs of people bringing thanksgiving offerings to the LORD. They will sing,\n\n‘Give thanks to the LORD of Heaven’s Armies,\nfor the LORD is good.\nHis faithful love endures forever!’\n\nFor I will restore the prosperity of this land to what it was in the past, says the LORD.\n“This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies says: This land—though it is now desolate and has no people and animals—will once more have pastures where shepherds can lead their flocks. Once again shepherds will count their flocks in the towns of the hill country, the foothills of Judah, the Negev, the land of Benjamin, the vicinity of Jerusalem, and all the towns of Judah. I, the LORD, have spoken!\n“The day will come, says the LORD, when I will do for Israel and Judah all the good things I have promised them.\n\n“In those days and at that time\nI will raise up a righteous descendant from King David’s line.\nHe will do what is just and right throughout the land.\nIn that day Judah will be saved,\nand Jerusalem will live in safety.\nAnd this will be its name:\n‘The LORD Is Our Righteousness.’\n\nFor this is what the LORD says: David will have a descendant sitting on the throne of Israel forever. And there will always be Levitical priests to offer burnt offerings and grain offerings and sacrifices to me.”\nThen this message came to Jeremiah from the LORD: “This is what the LORD says: If you can break my covenant with the day and the night so that one does not follow the other, only then will my covenant with my servant David be broken. Only then will he no longer have a descendant to reign on his throne. The same is true for my covenant with the Levitical priests who minister before me. And as the stars of the sky cannot be counted and the sand on the seashore cannot be measured, so I will multiply the descendants of my servant David and the Levites who minister before me.”\nThe LORD gave another message to Jeremiah. He said, “Have you noticed what people are saying?—‘The LORD chose Judah and Israel and then abandoned them!’ They are sneering and saying that Israel is not worthy to be counted as a nation. But this is what the LORD says: I would no more reject my people than I would change my laws that govern night and day, earth and sky. I will never abandon the descendants of Jacob or David, my servant, or change the plan that David’s descendants will rule the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Instead, I will restore them to their land and have mercy on them.”",

      "chapter_text": "King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came with all the armies from the kingdoms he ruled, and he fought against Jerusalem and the towns of Judah. At that time this message came to Jeremiah from the LORD: “Go to King Zedekiah of Judah, and tell him, ‘This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down. You will not escape his grasp but will be captured and taken to meet the king of Babylon face to face. Then you will be exiled to Babylon.\n“‘But listen to this promise from the LORD, O Zedekiah, king of Judah. This is what the LORD says: You will not be killed in war but will die peacefully. People will burn incense in your memory, just as they did for your ancestors, the kings who preceded you. They will mourn for you, crying, “Alas, our master is dead!” This I have decreed, says the LORD.’”\nSo Jeremiah the prophet delivered the message to King Zedekiah of Judah. At this time the Babylonian army was besieging Jerusalem, Lachish, and Azekah—the only fortified cities of Judah not yet captured.\n\nThis message came to Jeremiah from the LORD after King Zedekiah made a covenant with the people, proclaiming freedom for the slaves. He had ordered all the people to free their Hebrew slaves—both men and women. No one was to keep a fellow Judean in bondage. The officials and all the people had obeyed the king’s command, but later they changed their minds. They took back the men and women they had freed, forcing them to be slaves again.\nSo the LORD gave them this message through Jeremiah: “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your ancestors long ago when I rescued them from their slavery in Egypt. I told them that every Hebrew slave must be freed after serving six years. But your ancestors paid no attention to me. Recently you repented and did what was right, following my command. You freed your slaves and made a solemn covenant with me in the Temple that bears my name. But now you have shrugged off your oath and defiled my name by taking back the men and women you had freed, forcing them to be slaves once again.\n“Therefore, this is what the LORD says: Since you have not obeyed me by setting your countrymen free, I will set you free to be destroyed by war, disease, and famine. You will be an object of horror to all the nations of the earth. Because you have broken the terms of our covenant, I will cut you apart just as you cut apart the calf when you walked between its halves to solemnize your vows. Yes, I will cut you apart, whether you are officials of Judah or Jerusalem, court officials, priests, or common people—for you have broken your oath. I will give you to your enemies, and they will kill you. Your bodies will be food for the vultures and wild animals.\n“I will hand over King Zedekiah of Judah and his officials to the army of the king of Babylon. And although they have left Jerusalem for a while, I will call the Babylonian armies back again. They will fight against this city and will capture it and burn it down.

Take them into one of the inner rooms, and offer them some wine.”\nSo I went to see Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah and grandson of Habazziniah and all his brothers and sons—representing all the Recabite families. I took them to the Temple, and we went into the room assigned to the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, a man of God. This room was located next to the one used by the Temple officials, directly above the room of Maaseiah son of Shallum, the Temple gatekeeper.\nI set cups and jugs of wine before them and invited them to have a drink, but they refused. “No,” they said, “we don’t drink wine, because our ancestor Jehonadab son of Recab gave us this command: ‘You and your descendants must never drink wine. And do not build houses or plant crops or vineyards, but always live in tents. If you follow these commands, you will live long, good lives in the land.’ So we have obeyed him in all these things. We have never had a drink of wine to this day, nor have our wives, our sons, or our daughters. We haven’t built houses or owned vineyards or farms or planted crops. We have lived in tents and have fully obeyed all the commands of Jehonadab, our ancestor. But when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon attacked this country, we were afraid of the Babylonian and Syrian armies. So we decided to move to Jerusalem. That is why we are here.”\nThen the LORD gave this message to Jeremiah: “This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: Go and say to the people in Judah and Jerusalem, ‘Come and learn a lesson about how to obey me. The Recabites do not drink wine to this day because their ancestor Jehonadab told them not to. But I have spoken to you again and again, and you refuse to obey me. Time after time I sent you prophets, who told you, “Turn from your wicked ways, and start doing things right. Stop worshiping other gods so that you might live in peace here in the land I have given to you and your ancestors.” But you would not listen to me or obey me. The descendants of Jehonadab son of Recab have obeyed their ancestor completely, but you have refused to listen to me.’\n“Therefore, this is what the LORD God of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Because you refuse to listen or answer when I call, I will send upon Judah and Jerusalem all the disasters I have threatened.’”\nThen Jeremiah turned to the Recabites and said, “This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘You have obeyed your ancestor Jehonadab in every respect, following all his instructions.’ Therefore, this is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Jehonadab son of Recab will always have descendants who serve me.’”",

      "chapter_text": "LORD\nDuring the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king in Judah, the LORD gave this message to Jeremiah: “Get a scroll, and write down all my messages against Israel, Judah, and the other nations. Begin with the first message back in the days of Josiah, and write down every message, right up to the present time. Perhaps the people of Judah will repent when they hear again all the terrible things I have planned for them. Then I will be able to forgive their sins and wrongdoings.”\nSo Jeremiah sent for Baruch son of Neriah, and as Jeremiah dictated all the prophecies that the LORD had given him, Baruch wrote them on a scroll. Then Jeremiah said to Baruch, “I am a prisoner here and unable to go to the Temple. So you go to the Temple on the next day of fasting, and read the messages from the LORD that I have had you write on this scroll. Read them so the people who are there from all over Judah will hear them. Perhaps even yet they will turn from their evil ways and ask the LORD’s forgiveness before it is too late. For the LORD has threatened them with his terrible anger.”\nBaruch did as Jeremiah told him and read these messages from the LORD to the people at the Temple. He did this on a day of sacred fasting held in late autumn, during the fifth year of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah. People from all over Judah had come to Jerusalem to attend the services at the Temple on that day. Baruch read Jeremiah’s words on the scroll to all the people. He stood in front of the Temple room of Gemariah, son of Shaphan the secretary. This room was just off the upper courtyard of the Temple, near the New Gate entrance.\nWhen Micaiah son of Gemariah and grandson of Shaphan heard the messages from the LORD, he went down to the secretary’s room in the palace where the administrative officials were meeting. Elishama the secretary was there, along with Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Acbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials. When Micaiah told them about the messages Baruch was reading to the people, the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah, grandson of Shelemiah and great-grandson of Cushi, to ask Baruch to come and read the messages to them, too. So Baruch took the scroll and went to them. “Sit down and read the scroll to us,” the officials said, and Baruch did as they requested.\nWhen they heard all the messages, they looked at one another in alarm. “We must tell the king what we have heard,” they said to Baruch. “But first, tell us how you got these messages. Did they come directly from Jeremiah?”\nSo Baruch explained, “Jeremiah dictated them, and I wrote them down in ink, word for word, on this scroll.”\n“You and Jeremiah should both hide,” the officials told Baruch. “Don’t tell anyone where you are!” Then the officials left the scroll for safekeeping in the room of Elishama the secretary and went to tell the king what had happened.\n\nThe king sent Jehudi to get the scroll. Jehudi brought it from Elishama’s room and read it to the king as all his officials stood by. It was late autumn, and the king was in a winterized part of the palace, sitting in front of a fire to keep warm. Each time Jehudi finished reading three or four columns, the king took a knife and cut off that section of the scroll. He then threw it into the fire, section by section, until the whole scroll was burned up. Neither the king nor his attendants showed any signs of fear or repentance at what they heard. Even when Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah begged the king not to burn the scroll, he wouldn’t listen.\nThen the king commanded his son Jerahmeel, Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch and Jeremiah. But the LORD had hidden them.\n\nAfter the king had burned the scroll on which Baruch had written Jeremiah’s words, the LORD gave Jeremiah another message. He said, “Get another scroll, and write everything again just as you did on the scroll King Jehoiakim burned. Then say to the king, ‘This is what the LORD says: You burned the scroll because it said the king of Babylon would destroy this land and empty it of people and animals. Now this is what the LORD says about King Jehoiakim of Judah: He will have no heirs to sit on the throne of David. His dead body will be thrown out to lie unburied—exposed to the heat of the day and the frost of the night. I will punish him and his family and his attendants for their sins. I will pour out on them and on all the people of Jerusalem and Judah all the disasters I promised, for they would not listen to my warnings.’”\nSo Jeremiah took another scroll and dictated again to his secretary, Baruch. He wrote everything that had been on the scroll King Jehoiakim had burned in the fire. Only this time he added much more!",

But neither King Zedekiah nor his attendants nor the people who were left in the land listened to what the LORD said through Jeremiah.\nNevertheless, King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the priest, son of Maaseiah, to ask Jeremiah, “Please pray to the LORD our God for us.” Jeremiah had not yet been imprisoned, so he could come and go among the people as he pleased.\nAt this time the army of Pharaoh Hophra of Egypt appeared at the southern border of Judah. When the Babylonian army heard about it, they withdrew from their siege of Jerusalem.\nThen the LORD gave this message to Jeremiah: “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: The king of Judah sent you to ask me what is going to happen. Tell him, ‘Pharaoh’s army is about to return to Egypt, though he came here to help you. Then the Babylonians will come back and capture this city and burn it to the ground.’\n“This is what the LORD says: Do not fool yourselves into thinking that the Babylonians are gone for good. They aren’t! Even if you were to destroy the entire Babylonian army, leaving only a handful of wounded survivors, they would still stagger from their tents and burn this city to the ground!”\n\nWhen the Babylonian army left Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s approaching army, Jeremiah started to leave the city on his way to the territory of Benjamin, to claim his share of the property among his relatives there. But as he was walking through the Benjamin Gate, a sentry arrested him and said, “You are defecting to the Babylonians!” The sentry making the arrest was Irijah son of Shelemiah, grandson of Hananiah.\n“That’s not true!” Jeremiah protested. “I had no intention of doing any such thing.” But Irijah wouldn’t listen, and he took Jeremiah before the officials. They were furious with Jeremiah and had him flogged and imprisoned in the house of Jonathan the secretary. Jonathan’s house had been converted into a prison. Jeremiah was put into a dungeon cell, where he remained for many days.\nLater King Zedekiah secretly requested that Jeremiah come to the palace, where the king asked him, “Do you have any messages from the LORD?”\n“Yes, I do!” said Jeremiah. “You will be defeated by the king of Babylon.”\nThen Jeremiah asked the king, “What crime have I committed? What have I done against you, your attendants, or the people that I should be imprisoned like this? Where are your prophets now who told you the king of Babylon would not attack you or this land? Listen, my lord the king, I beg you. Don’t send me back to the dungeon in the house of Jonathan the secretary, for I will die there.”\nSo King Zedekiah commanded that Jeremiah not be returned to the dungeon. Instead, he was imprisoned in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace. The king also commanded that Jeremiah be given a loaf of fresh bread every day as long as there was any left in the city.

      "chapter_text": "Now Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malkijah heard what Jeremiah had been telling the people. He had been saying, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Everyone who stays in Jerusalem will die from war, famine, or disease, but those who surrender to the Babylonians will live. Their reward will be life. They will live!’ The LORD also says: ‘The city of Jerusalem will certainly be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon, who will capture it.’”\nSo these officials went to the king and said, “Sir, this man must die! That kind of talk will undermine the morale of the few fighting men we have left, as well as that of all the people. This man is a traitor!”\nKing Zedekiah agreed. “All right,” he said. “Do as you like. I can’t stop you.”\nSo the officials took Jeremiah from his cell and lowered him by ropes into an empty cistern in the prison yard. It belonged to Malkijah, a member of the royal family. There was no water in the cistern, but there was a thick layer of mud at the bottom, and Jeremiah sank down into it.\nBut Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, an important court official, heard that Jeremiah was in the cistern. At that time the king was holding court at the Benjamin Gate, so Ebed-melech rushed from the palace to speak with him. “My lord the king,” he said, “these men have done a very evil thing in putting Jeremiah the prophet into the cistern. He will soon die of hunger, for almost all the bread in the city is gone.”\nSo the king told Ebed-melech, “Take thirty of my men with you, and pull Jeremiah out of the cistern before he dies.”\nSo Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to a room in the palace beneath the treasury, where he found some old rags and discarded clothing. He carried these to the cistern and lowered them to Jeremiah on a rope. Ebed-melech called down to Jeremiah, “Put these rags under your armpits to protect you from the ropes.” Then when Jeremiah was ready, they pulled him out. So Jeremiah was returned to the courtyard of the guard—the palace prison—where he remained.\n\nOne day King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah and had him brought to the third entrance of the LORD’s Temple. “I want to ask you something,” the king said. “And don’t try to hide the truth.”\nJeremiah said, “If I tell you the truth, you will kill me. And if I give you advice, you won’t listen to me anyway.”\nSo King Zedekiah secretly promised him, “As surely as the LORD our Creator lives, I will not kill you or hand you over to the men who want you dead.”\nThen Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “This is what the LORD God of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you surrender to the Babylonian officers, you and your family will live, and the city will not be burned down. But if you refuse to surrender, you will not escape! This city will be handed over to the Babylonians, and they will burn it to the ground.’”\n“But I am afraid to surrender,” the king said, “for the Babylonians may hand me over to the Judeans who have defected to them. And who knows what they will do to me!”\nJeremiah replied, “You won’t be handed over to them if you choose to obey the LORD. Your life will be spared, and all will go well for you. But if you refuse to surrender, this is what the LORD has revealed to me: All the women left in your palace will be brought out and given to the officers of the Babylonian army. Then the women will taunt you, saying,\n\n‘What fine friends you have!\nThey have betrayed and misled you.\nWhen your feet sank in the mud,\nthey left you to your fate!’\n\nAll your wives and children will be led out to the Babylonians, and you will not escape. You will be seized by the king of Babylon, and this city will be burned down.”\nThen Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Don’t tell anyone you told me this, or you will die! My officials may hear that I spoke to you, and they may say, ‘Tell us what you and the king were talking about. If you don’t tell us, we will kill you.’ If this happens, just tell them you begged me not to send you back to Jonathan’s dungeon, for fear you would die there.”\nSure enough, it wasn’t long before the king’s officials came to Jeremiah and asked him why the king had called for him.

Two and a half years later, on July 18 in the eleventh year of Zedekiah’s reign, a section of the city wall was broken down. All the officers of the Babylonian army came in and sat in triumph at the Middle Gate: Nergal-sharezer of Samgar, and Nebo-sarsekim, a chief officer, and Nergal-sharezer, the king’s adviser, and all the other officers of the king of Babylon.\nWhen King Zedekiah of Judah and all the soldiers saw that the Babylonians had broken into the city, they fled. They waited for nightfall and then slipped through the gate between the two walls behind the king’s garden and headed toward the Jordan Valley.\nBut the Babylonian troops chased them and overtook Zedekiah on the plains of Jericho. They captured him and took him to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who was at Riblah in the land of Hamath. There the king of Babylon pronounced judgment upon Zedekiah. The king of Babylon made Zedekiah watch as he slaughtered his sons at Riblah. The king of Babylon also slaughtered all the nobles of Judah. Then he gouged out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in bronze chains to lead him away to Babylon.\nMeanwhile, the Babylonians burned Jerusalem, including the royal palace and the houses of the people, and they tore down the walls of the city. Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took as exiles to Babylon the rest of the people who remained in the city, those who had defected to him, and everyone else who remained. But Nebuzaradan allowed some of the poorest people to stay behind in the land of Judah, and he assigned them to care for the vineyards and fields.\n\nKing Nebuchadnezzar had told Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, to find Jeremiah. “See that he isn’t hurt,” he said. “Look after him well, and give him anything he wants.” So Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard; Nebushazban, a chief officer; Nergal-sharezer, the king’s adviser; and the other officers of Babylon’s king sent messengers to bring Jeremiah out of the prison. They put him under the care of Gedaliah son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, who took him back to his home. So Jeremiah stayed in Judah among his own people.\nThe LORD had given the following message to Jeremiah while he was still in prison: “Say to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, ‘This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: I will do to this city everything I have threatened. I will send disaster, not prosperity. You will see its destruction, but I will rescue you from those you fear so much. Because you trusted me, I will give you your life as a reward. I will rescue you and keep you safe. I, the LORD, have spoken!’”",

      "chapter_text": "The LORD gave a message to Jeremiah after Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had released him at Ramah. He had found Jeremiah bound in chains among all the other captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were being sent to exile in Babylon.\nThe captain of the guard called for Jeremiah and said, “The LORD your God has brought this disaster on this land, just as he said he would. For these people have sinned against the LORD and disobeyed him. That is why it happened. But I am going to take off your chains and let you go. If you want to come with me to Babylon, you are welcome. I will see that you are well cared for. But if you don’t want to come, you may stay here. The whole land is before you—go wherever you like. If you decide to stay, then return to Gedaliah son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan. He has been appointed governor of Judah by the king of Babylon. Stay there with the people he rules. But it’s up to you; go wherever you like.”\nThen Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, gave Jeremiah some food and money and let him go. So Jeremiah returned to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah, and he lived in Judah with the few who were still left in the land.\n\nThe leaders of the Judean military groups in the countryside heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam as governor over the poor people who were left behind in Judah—the men, women, and children who hadn’t been exiled to Babylon. So they went to see Gedaliah at Mizpah. These included: Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, Jezaniah son of the Maacathite, and all their men.\nGedaliah vowed to them that the Babylonians meant them no harm. “Don’t be afraid to serve them. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and all will go well for you,” he promised. “As for me, I will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians who come to meet with us. Settle in the towns you have taken, and live off the land. Harvest the grapes and summer fruits and olives, and store them away.”\nWhen the Judeans in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and the other nearby countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a few people in Judah and that Gedaliah was the governor, they began to return to Judah from the places to which they had fled. They stopped at Mizpah to meet with Gedaliah and then went into the Judean countryside to gather a great harvest of grapes and other crops.\n\nSoon after this, Johanan son of Kareah and the other military leaders came to Gedaliah at Mizpah.

While they were eating together, Ishmael and his ten men suddenly jumped up, drew their swords, and killed Gedaliah, whom the king of Babylon had appointed governor. Ishmael also killed all the Judeans and the Babylonian soldiers who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah.\nThe next day, before anyone had heard about Gedaliah’s murder, eighty men arrived from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria to worship at the Temple of the LORD. They had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes, and cut themselves, and had brought along grain offerings and frankincense. Ishmael left Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. When he reached them, he said, “Oh, come and see what has happened to Gedaliah!”\nBut as soon as they were all inside the town, Ishmael and his men killed all but ten of them and threw their bodies into a cistern. The other ten had talked Ishmael into letting them go by promising to bring him their stores of wheat, barley, olive oil, and honey that they had hidden away. The cistern where Ishmael dumped the bodies of the men he murdered was the large one dug by King Asa when he fortified Mizpah to protect himself against King Baasha of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with corpses.\nThen Ishmael made captives of the king’s daughters and the other people who had been left under Gedaliah’s care in Mizpah by Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard. Taking them with him, he started back toward the land of Ammon.\nBut when Johanan son of Kareah and the other military leaders heard about Ishmael’s crimes, they took all their men and set out to stop him. They caught up with him at the large pool near Gibeon. The people Ishmael had captured shouted for joy when they saw Johanan and the other military leaders. And all the captives from Mizpah escaped and began to help Johanan. Meanwhile, Ishmael and eight of his men escaped from Johanan into the land of Ammon.\nThen Johanan son of Kareah and the other military leaders took all the people they had rescued in Gibeon—the soldiers, women, children, and court officials whom Ishmael had captured after he killed Gedaliah. They took them all to the village of Geruth-kimham near Bethlehem, where they prepared to leave for Egypt. They were afraid of what the Babylonians would do when they heard that Ishmael had killed Gedaliah, the governor appointed by the Babylonian king.",

They said, “Please pray to the LORD your God for us. As you can see, we are only a tiny remnant compared to what we were before. Pray that the LORD your God will show us what to do and where to go.”\n“All right,” Jeremiah replied. “I will pray to the LORD your God, as you have asked, and I will tell you everything he says. I will hide nothing from you.”\nThen they said to Jeremiah, “May the LORD your God be a faithful witness against us if we refuse to obey whatever he tells us to do! Whether we like it or not, we will obey the LORD our God to whom we are sending you with our plea. For if we obey him, everything will turn out well for us.”\nTen days later the LORD gave his reply to Jeremiah. So he called for Johanan son of Kareah and the other military leaders, and for all the people, from the least to the greatest. He said to them, “You sent me to the LORD, the God of Israel, with your request, and this is his reply: ‘Stay here in this land. If you do, I will build you up and not tear you down; I will plant you and not uproot you. For I am sorry about all the punishment I have had to bring upon you. Do not fear the king of Babylon anymore,’ says the LORD. ‘For I am with you and will save you and rescue you from his power. I will be merciful to you by making him kind, so he will let you stay here in your land.’\n“But if you refuse to obey the LORD your God, and if you say, ‘We will not stay here; instead, we will go to Egypt where we will be free from war, the call to arms, and hunger,’ then hear the LORD’s message to the remnant of Judah. This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you are determined to go to Egypt and live there, the very war and famine you fear will catch up to you, and you will die there. That is the fate awaiting every one of you who insists on going to live in Egypt. Yes, you will die from war, famine, and disease. None of you will escape the disaster I will bring upon you there.’\n“This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Just as my anger and fury have been poured out on the people of Jerusalem, so they will be poured out on you when you enter Egypt. You will be an object of damnation, horror, cursing, and mockery. And you will never see your homeland again.’\n“Listen, you remnant of Judah. The LORD has told you: ‘Do not go to Egypt!’ Don’t forget this warning I have given you today. For you were not being honest when you sent me to pray to the LORD your God for you. You said, ‘Just tell us what the LORD our God says, and we will do it!’ And today I have told you exactly what he said, but you will not obey the LORD your God any better now than you have in the past. So you can be sure that you will die from war, famine, and disease in Egypt, where you insist on going.”",

Baruch son of Neriah has convinced you to say this, because he wants us to stay here and be killed by the Babylonians or be carried off into exile.”\nSo Johanan and the other military leaders and all the people refused to obey the LORD’s command to stay in Judah. Johanan and the other leaders took with them all the people who had returned from the nearby countries to which they had fled. In the crowd were men, women, and children, the king’s daughters, and all those whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had left with Gedaliah. The prophet Jeremiah and Baruch were also included. The people refused to obey the voice of the LORD and went to Egypt, going as far as the city of Tahpanhes.\nThen at Tahpanhes, the LORD gave another message to Jeremiah. He said, “While the people of Judah are watching, take some large rocks and bury them under the pavement stones at the entrance of Pharaoh’s palace here in Tahpanhes. Then say to the people of Judah, ‘This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: I will certainly bring my servant Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, here to Egypt. I will set his throne over these stones that I have hidden. He will spread his royal canopy over them. And when he comes, he will destroy the land of Egypt. He will bring death to those destined for death, captivity to those destined for captivity, and war to those destined for war. He will set fire to the temples of Egypt’s gods; he will burn the temples and carry the idols away as plunder. He will pick clean the land of Egypt as a shepherd picks fleas from his cloak. And he himself will leave unharmed. He will break down the sacred pillars standing in the temple of the sun in Egypt, and he will burn down the temples of Egypt’s gods.’”",

They now lie deserted and in ruins. They provoked my anger with all their wickedness. They burned incense and worshiped other gods—gods that neither they nor you nor any of your ancestors had ever even known.\n“Again and again I sent my servants, the prophets, to plead with them, ‘Don’t do these horrible things that I hate so much.’ But my people would not listen or turn back from their wicked ways. They kept on burning incense to these gods. And so my fury boiled over and fell like fire on the towns of Judah and into the streets of Jerusalem, and they are still a desolate ruin today.\n“And now the LORD God of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, asks you: Why are you destroying yourselves? For not one of you will survive—not a man, woman, or child among you who has come here from Judah, not even the babies in your arms. Why provoke my anger by burning incense to the idols you have made here in Egypt? You will only destroy yourselves and make yourselves an object of cursing and mockery for all the nations of the earth. Have you forgotten the sins of your ancestors, the sins of the kings and queens of Judah, and the sins you and your wives committed in Judah and Jerusalem? To this very hour you have shown no remorse or reverence. No one has chosen to follow my word and the decrees I gave to you and your ancestors before you.\n“Therefore, this is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: I am determined to destroy every one of you! I will take this remnant of Judah—those who were determined to come here and live in Egypt—and I will consume them. They will fall here in Egypt, killed by war and famine. All will die, from the least to the greatest. They will be an object of damnation, horror, cursing, and mockery. I will punish them in Egypt just as I punished them in Jerusalem, by war, famine, and disease. Of that remnant who fled to Egypt, hoping someday to return to Judah, there will be no survivors. Even though they long to return home, only a handful will do so.”\nThen all the women present and all the men who knew that their wives had burned incense to idols—a great crowd of all the Judeans living in northern Egypt and southern Egypt—answered Jeremiah, “We will not listen to your messages from the LORD! We will do whatever we want. We will burn incense and pour out liquid offerings to the Queen of Heaven just as much as we like—just as we, and our ancestors, and our kings and officials have always done in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. For in those days we had plenty to eat, and we were well off and had no troubles! But ever since we quit burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and stopped worshiping her with liquid offerings, we have been in great trouble and have been dying from war and famine.”\n“Besides,” the women added, “do you suppose that we were burning incense and pouring out liquid offerings to the Queen of Heaven, and making cakes marked with her image, without our husbands knowing it and helping us? Of course not!”\nThen Jeremiah said to all of them, men and women alike, who had given him that answer, “Do you think the LORD did not know that you and your ancestors, your kings and officials, and all the people were burning incense to idols in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? It was because the LORD could no longer bear all the disgusting things you were doing that he made your land an object of cursing—a desolate ruin without inhabitants—as it is today. All these terrible things happened to you because you have burned incense to idols and sinned against the LORD. You have refused to obey him and have not followed his instructions, his decrees, and his laws.”\nThen Jeremiah said to them all, including the women, “Listen to this message from the LORD, all you citizens of Judah who live in Egypt. This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘You and your wives have said, “We will keep our promises to burn incense and pour out liquid offerings to the Queen of Heaven,” and you have proved by your actions that you meant it. So go ahead and carry out your promises and vows to her!’\n“But listen to this message from the LORD, all you Judeans now living in Egypt: ‘I have sworn by my great name,’ says the LORD, ‘that my name will no longer be spoken by any of the Judeans in the land of Egypt. None of you may invoke my name or use this oath: “As surely as the Sovereign LORD lives.” For I will watch over you to bring you disaster and not good. Everyone from Judah who is now living in Egypt will suffer war and famine until all of you are dead. Only a small number will escape death and return to Judah from Egypt. Then all those who came to Egypt will find out whose words are true—mine or theirs!\n“‘And this is the proof I give you,’ says the LORD, ‘that all I have threatened will happen to you and that I will punish you here.’ This is what the LORD says: ‘I will turn Pharaoh Hophra, king of Egypt, over to his enemies who want to kill him, just as I turned King Zedekiah of Judah over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.’”",

Get ready to leave for exile,\nyou citizens of Egypt!\nThe city of Memphis will be destroyed,\nwithout a single inhabitant.\nEgypt is as sleek as a beautiful heifer,\nbut a horsefly from the north is on its way!\nEgypt’s mercenaries have become like fattened calves.\nThey, too, will turn and run,\nfor it is a day of great disaster for Egypt,\na time of great punishment.\nEgypt flees, silent as a serpent gliding away.\nThe invading army marches in;\nthey come against her with axes like woodsmen.\nThey will cut down her people like trees,” says the LORD,\n“for they are more numerous than locusts.\nEgypt will be humiliated;\nshe will be handed over to people from the north.”\n\nThe LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says: “I will punish Amon, the god of Thebes, and all the other gods of Egypt. I will punish its rulers and Pharaoh, too, and all who trust in him. I will hand them over to those who want them killed—to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and his army. But afterward the land will recover from the ravages of war. I, the LORD, have spoken!\n\n“But do not be afraid, Jacob, my servant;\ndo not be dismayed, Israel.\nFor I will bring you home again from distant lands,\nand your children will return from their exile.\nIsrael will return to a life of peace and quiet,\nand no one will terrorize them.\nDo not be afraid, Jacob, my servant,\nfor I am with you,” says the LORD.\n“I will completely destroy the nations to which I have exiled you,\nbut I will not completely destroy you.\nI will discipline you, but with justice;\nI cannot let you go unpunished.”",

This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says:\n\n“What sorrow awaits the city of Nebo;\nit will soon lie in ruins.\nThe city of Kiriathaim will be humiliated and captured;\nthe fortress will be humiliated and broken down.\nNo one will ever brag about Moab again,\nfor in Heshbon there is a plot to destroy her.\n‘Come,’ they say, ‘we will cut her off from being a nation.’\nThe town of Madmen, too, will be silenced;\nthe sword will follow you there.\nListen to the cries from Horonaim,\ncries of devastation and great destruction.\nAll Moab is destroyed.\nHer little ones will cry out.\nHer refugees weep bitterly,\nclimbing the slope to Luhith.\nThey cry out in terror,\ndescending the slope to Horonaim.\nFlee for your lives!\nHide in the wilderness!\nBecause you have trusted in your wealth and skill,\nyou will be taken captive.\nYour god Chemosh, with his priests and officials,\nwill be hauled off to distant lands!\n\n“All the towns will be destroyed,\nand no one will escape—\neither on the plateaus or in the valleys,\nfor the LORD has spoken.\nOh, that Moab had wings\nso she could fly away,\nfor her towns will be left empty,\nwith no one living in them.\nCursed are those who refuse to do the LORD’s work,\nwho hold back their swords from shedding blood!\n\n“From his earliest history, Moab has lived in peace,\nnever going into exile.\nHe is like wine that has been allowed to settle.\nHe has not been poured from flask to flask,\nand he is now fragrant and smooth.\nBut the time is coming soon,” says the LORD,\n“when I will send men to pour him from his jar.\nThey will pour him out,\nthen shatter the jar!\nAt last Moab will be ashamed of his idol Chemosh,\nas the people of Israel were ashamed of their gold calf at Bethel.\n\n“You used to boast, ‘We are heroes,\nmighty men of war.’\nBut now Moab and his towns will be destroyed.\nHis most promising youth are doomed to slaughter,”\nsays the King, whose name is the LORD of Heaven’s Armies.\n“Destruction is coming fast for Moab;\ncalamity threatens ominously.\nYou friends of Moab,\nweep for him and cry!\nSee how the strong scepter is broken,\nhow the beautiful staff is shattered!\n\n“Come down from your glory\nand sit in the dust, you people of Dibon,\nfor those who destroy Moab will shatter Dibon, too.\nThey will tear down all your towers.\nYou people of Aroer,\nstand beside the road and watch.\nShout to those who flee from Moab,\n‘What has happened there?’\n\n“And the reply comes back,\n‘Moab lies in ruins, disgraced;\nweep and wail!\nTell it by the banks of the Arnon River:\nMoab has been destroyed!’\nJudgment has been poured out on the towns of the plateau—\non Holon and Jahaz and Mephaath,\non Dibon and Nebo and Beth-diblathaim,\non Kiriathaim and Beth-gamul and Beth-meon,\non Kerioth and Bozrah—\nall the towns of Moab, far and near.\n\n“The strength of Moab has ended.\nHis arm has been broken,” says the LORD.\n“Let him stagger and fall like a drunkard,\nfor he has rebelled against the LORD.\nMoab will wallow in his own vomit,\nridiculed by all.\nDid you not ridicule the people of Israel?\nWere they caught in the company of thieves\nthat you should despise them as you do?\n\n“You people of Moab,\nflee from your towns and live in the caves.\nHide like doves that nest\nin the clefts of the rocks.\nWe have all heard of the pride of Moab,\nfor his pride is very great.\nWe know of his lofty pride,\nhis arrogance, and his haughty heart.\nI know about his insolence,”\nsays the LORD,\n“but his boasts are empty—\nas empty as his deeds.\nSo now I wail for Moab;\nyes, I will mourn for Moab.\nMy heart is broken for the men of Kir-hareseth.\n\n“You people of Sibmah, rich in vineyards,\nI will weep for you even more than I did for Jazer.\nYour spreading vines once reached as far as the Dead Sea,\nbut the destroyer has stripped you bare!\nHe has harvested your grapes and summer fruits.\nJoy and gladness are gone from fruitful Moab.\nThe presses yield no wine.\nNo one treads the grapes with shouts of joy.\nThere is shouting, yes, but not of joy.\n\n“Instead, their awful cries of terror can be heard from Heshbon clear across to Elealeh and Jahaz; from Zoar all the way to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah. Even the waters of Nimrim are dried up now.\n“I will put an end to Moab,” says the LORD, “for the people offer sacrifices at the pagan shrines and burn incense to their false gods. My heart moans like a flute for Moab and Kir-hareseth, for all their wealth has disappeared. The people shave their heads and beards in mourning. They slash their hands and put on clothes made of burlap. There is crying and sorrow in every Moabite home and on every street. For I have smashed Moab like an old, unwanted jar. How it is shattered! Hear the wailing! See the shame of Moab! It has become an object of ridicule, an example of ruin to all its neighbors.”\nThis is what the LORD says:\n\n“Look! The enemy swoops down like an eagle,\nspreading his wings over Moab.\nIts cities will fall,\nand its strongholds will be seized.\nEven the mightiest warriors will be in anguish\nlike a woman in labor.\nMoab will no longer be a nation,\nfor it has boasted against the LORD.\n\n“Terror and traps and snares will be your lot,\nO Moab,” says the LORD.\n“Those who flee in terror will fall into a trap,\nand those who escape the trap will step into a snare.\nI will see to it that you do not get away,\nfor the time of your judgment has come,”\nsays the LORD.\n“The people flee as far as Heshbon\nbut are unable to go on.\nFor a fire comes from Heshbon,\nKing Sihon’s ancient home,\nto devour the entire land\nwith all its rebellious people.\n\n“What sorrow awaits you, O people of Moab!\nThe people of the god Chemosh are destroyed!\nYour sons and your daughters\nhave been taken away as captives.\nBut I will restore the fortunes of Moab\nin days to come.\nI, the LORD, have spoken!”\n\nThis is the end of Jeremiah’s prophecy concerning Moab.",

This is what the LORD says:\n\n“Are there no descendants of Israel\nto inherit the land of Gad?\nWhy are you, who worship Molech,\nliving in its towns?\nIn the days to come,” says the LORD,\n“I will sound the battle cry against your city of Rabbah.\nIt will become a desolate heap of ruins,\nand the neighboring towns will be burned.\nThen Israel will take back the land\nyou took from her,” says the LORD.\n\n“Cry out, O Heshbon,\nfor the town of Ai is destroyed.\nWeep, O people of Rabbah!\nPut on your clothes of mourning.\nWeep and wail, hiding in the hedges,\nfor your god Molech, with his priests and officials,\nwill be hauled off to distant lands.\nYou are proud of your fertile valleys,\nbut they will soon be ruined.\nYou trusted in your wealth,\nyou rebellious daughter,\nand thought no one could ever harm you.\nBut look! I will bring terror upon you,”\nsays the Lord, the LORD of Heaven’s Armies.\n“Your neighbors will chase you from your land,\nand no one will help your exiles as they flee.\nBut I will restore the fortunes of the Ammonites\nin days to come.\nI, the LORD, have spoken.”\n\nThis message was given concerning Edom. This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies says:\n\n“Is there no wisdom in Teman?\nIs no one left to give wise counsel?\nTurn and flee!\nHide in deep caves, you people of Dedan!\nFor when I bring disaster on Edom,\nI will punish you, too!\nThose who harvest grapes\nalways leave a few for the poor.\nIf thieves came at night,\nthey would not take everything.\nBut I will strip bare the land of Edom,\nand there will be no place left to hide.\nIts children, its brothers, and its neighbors\nwill all be destroyed,\nand Edom itself will be no more.\nBut I will protect the orphans who remain among you.\nYour widows, too, can depend on me for help.”\n\nAnd this is what the LORD says: “If the innocent must suffer, how much more must you! You will not go unpunished! You must drink this cup of judgment! For I have sworn by my own name,” says the LORD, “that Bozrah will become an object of horror and a heap of ruins; it will be mocked and cursed. All its towns and villages will be desolate forever.”\n\nI have heard a message from the LORD\nthat an ambassador was sent to the nations to say,\n“Form a coalition against Edom,\nand prepare for battle!”\n\nThe LORD says to Edom,\n“I will cut you down to size among the nations.\nYou will be despised by all.\nYou have been deceived\nby the fear you inspire in others\nand by your own pride.\nYou live in a rock fortress\nand control the mountain heights.\nBut even if you make your nest among the peaks with the eagles,\nI will bring you crashing down,”\nsays the LORD.\n\n“Edom will be an object of horror.\nAll who pass by will be appalled\nand will gasp at the destruction they see there.\nIt will be like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah\nand their neighboring towns,” says the LORD.\n“No one will live there;\nno one will inhabit it.\nI will come like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan,\nleaping on the sheep in the pasture.\nI will chase Edom from its land,\nand I will appoint the leader of my choice.\nFor who is like me, and who can challenge me?\nWhat ruler can oppose my will?”\n\nListen to the LORD’s plans against Edom\nand the people of Teman.\nEven the little children will be dragged off like sheep,\nand their homes will be destroyed.\nThe earth will shake with the noise of Edom’s fall,\nand its cry of despair will be heard all the way to the Red Sea.\nLook! The enemy swoops down like an eagle,\nspreading his wings over Bozrah.\nEven the mightiest warriors will be in anguish\nlike a woman in labor.\n\nThis message was given concerning Damascus. This is what the LORD says:\n\n“The towns of Hamath and Arpad are struck with fear,\nfor they have heard the news of their destruction.\nTheir hearts are troubled\nlike a wild sea in a raging storm.\nDamascus has become feeble,\nand all her people turn to flee.\nFear, anguish, and pain have gripped her\nas they grip a woman in labor.\nThat famous city, a city of joy,\nwill be forsaken!\nHer young men will fall in the streets and die.\nHer soldiers will all be killed,”\nsays the LORD of Heaven’s Armies.\n“And I will set fire to the walls of Damascus\nthat will burn up the palaces of Ben-hadad.”\n\nThis message was given concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which were attacked by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. This is what the LORD says:\n\n“Advance against Kedar!\nDestroy the warriors from the East!\nTheir flocks and tents will be captured,\nand their household goods and camels will be taken away.\nEverywhere shouts of panic will be heard:\n‘We are terrorized at every turn!’\nRun for your lives,” says the LORD.\n“Hide yourselves in deep caves, you people of Hazor,\nfor King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon has plotted against you\nand is preparing to destroy you.\n\n“Go up and attack that complacent nation,”\nsays the LORD.\n“Its people live alone in the desert\nwithout walls or gates.\nTheir camels and other livestock will all be yours.\nI will scatter to the winds these people\nwho live in remote places.\nI will bring calamity upon them\nfrom every direction,” says the LORD.\n“Hazor will be inhabited by jackals,\nand it will be desolate forever.\nNo one will live there;\nno one will inhabit it.”\n\nThis message concerning Elam came to the prophet Jeremiah from the LORD at the beginning of the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah. This is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies says:\n\n“I will destroy the archers of Elam—\nthe best of their forces.\nI will bring enemies from all directions,\nand I will scatter the people of Elam to the four winds.\nThey will be exiled to countries around the world.\nI myself will go with Elam’s enemies to shatter it.\nIn my fierce anger, I will bring great disaster\nupon the people of Elam,” says the LORD.\n“Their enemies will chase them with the sword\nuntil I have destroyed them completely.\nI will set my throne in Elam,” says the LORD,\n“and I will destroy its king and officials.\nBut I will restore the fortunes of Elam\nin days to come.\nI, the LORD, have spoken!”",

She surrenders!\nHer walls have fallen.\nIt is the LORD’s vengeance,\nso take vengeance on her.\nDo to her as she has done to others!\nTake from Babylon all those who plant crops;\nsend all the harvesters away.\nBecause of the sword of the enemy,\neveryone will run away and rush back to their own lands.\n\n“The Israelites are like sheep\nthat have been scattered by lions.\nFirst the king of Assyria ate them up.\nThen King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon cracked their bones.”\nTherefore, this is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies,\nthe God of Israel, says:\n“Now I will punish the king of Babylon and his land,\njust as I punished the king of Assyria.\nAnd I will bring Israel home again to its own land,\nto feed in the fields of Carmel and Bashan,\nand to be satisfied once more\nin the hill country of Ephraim and Gilead.\nIn those days,” says the LORD,\n“no sin will be found in Israel or in Judah,\nfor I will forgive the remnant I preserve.\nLORD\n“Go up, my warriors, against the land of Merathaim\nand against the people of Pekod.\nPursue, kill, and completely destroy them,\nas I have commanded you,” says the LORD.\n“Let the battle cry be heard in the land,\na shout of great destruction.\nBabylon, the mightiest hammer in all the earth,\nlies broken and shattered.\nBabylon is desolate among the nations!\nListen, Babylon, for I have set a trap for you.\nYou are caught, for you have fought against the LORD.\nThe LORD has opened his armory\nand brought out weapons to vent his fury.\nThe terror that falls upon the Babylonians\nwill be the work of the Sovereign LORD of Heaven’s Armies.\nYes, come against her from distant lands.\nBreak open her granaries.\nCrush her walls and houses into heaps of rubble.\nDestroy her completely, and leave nothing!\nDestroy even her young bulls—\nit will be terrible for them, too!\nSlaughter them all!\nFor Babylon’s day of reckoning has come.\nListen to the people who have escaped from Babylon,\nas they tell in Jerusalem\nhow the LORD our God has taken vengeance\nagainst those who destroyed his Temple.\n\n“Send out a call for archers to come to Babylon.\nSurround the city so none can escape.\nDo to her as she has done to others,\nfor she has defied the LORD, the Holy One of Israel.\nHer young men will fall in the streets and die.\nHer soldiers will all be killed,”\nsays the LORD.\n\n“See, I am your enemy, you arrogant people,”\nsays the Lord, the LORD of Heaven’s Armies.\n“Your day of reckoning has arrived—\nthe day when I will punish you.\nO land of arrogance, you will stumble and fall,\nand no one will raise you up.\nFor I will light a fire in the cities of Babylon\nthat will burn up everything around them.”\n\nThis is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies says:\n“The people of Israel and Judah have been wronged.\nTheir captors hold them and refuse to let them go.\nBut the one who redeems them is strong.\nHis name is the LORD of Heaven’s Armies.\nHe will defend them\nand give them rest again in Israel.\nBut for the people of Babylon\nthere will be no rest!\n\n“The sword of destruction will strike the Babylonians,”\nsays the LORD.\n“It will strike the people of Babylon—\nher officials and wise men, too.\nThe sword will strike her wise counselors,\nand they will become fools.\nThe sword will strike her mightiest warriors,\nand panic will seize them.\nThe sword will strike her horses and chariots\nand her allies from other lands,\nand they will all become like women.\nThe sword will strike her treasures,\nand they all will be plundered.\nA drought will strike her water supply,\ncausing it to dry up.\nAnd why? Because the whole land is filled with idols,\nand the people are madly in love with them.\n\n“Soon Babylon will be inhabited by desert animals and hyenas.\nIt will be a home for owls.\nNever again will people live there;\nit will lie desolate forever.\nI will destroy it as I destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah\nand their neighboring towns,” says the LORD.\n“No one will live there;\nno one will inhabit it.\n\n“Look! A great army is coming from the north.\nA great nation and many kings\nare rising against you from far-off lands.\nThey are armed with bows and spears.\nThey are cruel and show no mercy.\nAs they ride forward on horses,\nthey sound like a roaring sea.\nThey are coming in battle formation,\nplanning to destroy you, Babylon.\nThe king of Babylon has heard reports about the enemy,\nand he is weak with fright.\nPangs of anguish have gripped him,\nlike those of a woman in labor.\n\n“I will come like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan,\nleaping on the sheep in the pasture.\nI will chase Babylon from its land,\nand I will appoint the leader of my choice.\nFor who is like me, and who can challenge me?\nWhat ruler can oppose my will?”\n\nListen to the LORD’s plans against Babylon\nand the land of the Babylonians.\nEven the little children will be dragged off like sheep,\nand their homes will be destroyed.\nThe earth will shake with the shout, “Babylon has been taken!”\nand its cry of despair will be heard around the world.",

Save yourselves!\nDon’t get trapped in her punishment!\nIt is the LORD’s time for vengeance;\nhe will repay her in full.\nBabylon has been a gold cup in the LORD’s hands,\na cup that made the whole earth drunk.\nThe nations drank Babylon’s wine,\nand it drove them all mad.\nBut suddenly Babylon, too, has fallen.\nWeep for her.\nGive her medicine.\nPerhaps she can yet be healed.\nWe would have helped her if we could,\nbut nothing can save her now.\nLet her go; abandon her.\nReturn now to your own land.\nFor her punishment reaches to the heavens;\nit is so great it cannot be measured.\nThe LORD has vindicated us.\nCome, let us announce in Jerusalem\neverything the LORD our God has done.\n\nSharpen the arrows!\nLift up the shields!\nFor the LORD has inspired the kings of the Medes\nto march against Babylon and destroy her.\nThis is his vengeance against those\nwho desecrated his Temple.\nRaise the battle flag against Babylon!\nReinforce the guard and station the watchmen.\nPrepare an ambush,\nfor the LORD will fulfill all his plans against Babylon.\nYou are a city by a great river,\na great center of commerce,\nbut your end has come.\nThe thread of your life is cut.\nThe LORD of Heaven’s Armies has taken this vow\nand has sworn to it by his own name:\n“Your cities will be filled with enemies,\nlike fields swarming with locusts,\nand they will shout in triumph over you.”\nLORD\nThe LORD made the earth by his power,\nand he preserves it by his wisdom.\nWith his own understanding\nhe stretched out the heavens.\nWhen he speaks in the thunder,\nthe heavens roar with rain.\nHe causes the clouds to rise over the earth.\nHe sends the lightning with the rain\nand releases the wind from his storehouses.\n\nThe whole human race is foolish and has no knowledge!\nThe craftsmen are disgraced by the idols they make,\nfor their carefully shaped works are a fraud.\nThese idols have no breath or power.\nIdols are worthless; they are ridiculous lies!\nOn the day of reckoning they will all be destroyed.\nBut the God of Israel is no idol!\nHe is the Creator of everything that exists,\nincluding his people, his own special possession.\nThe LORD of Heaven’s Armies is his name!\n\n“You are my battle-ax and sword,”\nsays the LORD.\n“With you I will shatter nations\nand destroy many kingdoms.\nWith you I will shatter armies—\ndestroying the horse and rider,\nthe chariot and charioteer.\nWith you I will shatter men and women,\nold people and children,\nyoung men and young women.\nWith you I will shatter shepherds and flocks,\nfarmers and oxen,\ncaptains and officers.\n\n“I will repay Babylon\nand the people of Babylonia\nfor all the wrong they have done\nto my people in Jerusalem,” says the LORD.\n\n“Look, O mighty mountain, destroyer of the earth!\nI am your enemy,” says the LORD.\n“I will raise my fist against you,\nto knock you down from the heights.\nWhen I am finished,\nyou will be nothing but a heap of burnt rubble.\nYou will be desolate forever.\nEven your stones will never again be used for building.\nYou will be completely wiped out,”\nsays the LORD.\n\nRaise a signal flag to the nations.\nSound the battle cry!\nMobilize them all against Babylon.\nPrepare them to fight against her!\nBring out the armies of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz.\nAppoint a commander,\nand bring a multitude of horses like swarming locusts!\nBring against her the armies of the nations—\nled by the kings of the Medes\nand all their captains and officers.\n\nThe earth trembles and writhes in pain,\nfor everything the LORD has planned against Babylon stands unchanged.\nBabylon will be left desolate without a single inhabitant.\nHer mightiest warriors no longer fight.\nThey stay in their barracks, their courage gone.\nThey have become like women.\nThe invaders have burned the houses\nand broken down the city gates.\nThe news is passed from one runner to the next\nas the messengers hurry to tell the king\nthat his city has been captured.\nAll the escape routes are blocked.\nThe marshes have been set aflame,\nand the army is in a panic.\n\nThis is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies,\nthe God of Israel, says:\n“Babylon is like wheat on a threshing floor,\nabout to be trampled.\nIn just a little while\nher harvest will begin.”\n\n“King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon has eaten and crushed us\nand drained us of strength.\nHe has swallowed us like a great monster\nand filled his belly with our riches.\nHe has thrown us out of our own country.\nMake Babylon suffer as she made us suffer,”\nsay the people of Zion.\n“Make the people of Babylonia pay for spilling our blood,”\nsays Jerusalem.\nLORD\nThis is what the LORD says to Jerusalem:\n\n“I will be your lawyer to plead your case,\nand I will avenge you.\nI will dry up her river,\nas well as her springs,\nand Babylon will become a heap of ruins,\nhaunted by jackals.\nShe will be an object of horror and contempt,\na place where no one lives.\nHer people will roar together like strong lions.\nThey will growl like lion cubs.\nAnd while they lie inflamed with all their wine,\nI will prepare a different kind of feast for them.\nI will make them drink until they fall asleep,\nand they will never wake up again,”\nsays the LORD.\n“I will bring them down\nlike lambs to the slaughter,\nlike rams and goats to be sacrificed.\n\n“How Babylon is fallen—\ngreat Babylon, praised throughout the earth!\nNow she has become an object of horror\namong the nations.\nThe sea has risen over Babylon;\nshe is covered by its crashing waves.\nHer cities now lie in ruins;\nshe is a dry wasteland\nwhere no one lives or even passes by.\nAnd I will punish Bel, the god of Babylon,\nand make him vomit up all he has eaten.\nThe nations will no longer come and worship him.\nThe wall of Babylon has fallen!\n\n“Come out, my people, flee from Babylon.\nSave yourselves! Run from the LORD’s fierce anger.\nBut do not panic; don’t be afraid\nwhen you hear the first rumor of approaching forces.\nFor rumors will keep coming year by year.\nViolence will erupt in the land\nas the leaders fight against each other.\nFor the time is surely coming\nwhen I will punish this great city and all her idols.\nHer whole land will be disgraced,\nand her dead will lie in the streets.\nThen the heavens and earth will rejoice,\nfor out of the north will come destroying armies\nagainst Babylon,” says the LORD.\n“Just as Babylon killed the people of Israel\nand others throughout the world,\nso must her people be killed.\nGet out, all you who have escaped the sword!\nDo not stand and watch—flee while you can!\nRemember the LORD, though you are in a far-off land,\nand think about your home in Jerusalem.”\n\n“We are ashamed,” the people say.\n“We are insulted and disgraced\nbecause the LORD’s Temple\nhas been defiled by foreigners.”\n\n“Yes,” says the LORD, “but the time is coming\nwhen I will destroy Babylon’s idols.\nThe groans of her wounded people\nwill be heard throughout the land.\nThough Babylon reaches as high as the heavens\nand makes her fortifications incredibly strong,\nI will still send enemies to plunder her.\nI, the LORD, have spoken!\n\n“Listen! Hear the cry of Babylon,\nthe sound of great destruction from the land of the Babylonians.\nFor the LORD is destroying Babylon.\nHe will silence her loud voice.\nWaves of enemies pound against her;\nthe noise of battle rings through the city.\nDestroying armies come against Babylon.\nHer mighty men are captured,\nand their weapons break in their hands.\nFor the LORD is a God who gives just punishment;\nhe always repays in full.\nI will make her officials and wise men drunk,\nalong with her captains, officers, and warriors.\nThey will fall asleep\nand never wake up again!”\nsays the King, whose name is\nthe LORD of Heaven’s Armies.\n\nThis is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies says:\n“The thick walls of Babylon will be leveled to the ground,\nand her massive gates will be burned.\nThe builders from many lands have worked in vain,\nfor their work will be destroyed by fire!”\n\nThe prophet Jeremiah gave this message to Seraiah son of Neriah and grandson of Mahseiah, a staff officer, when Seraiah went to Babylon with King Zedekiah of Judah. This was during the fourth year of Zedekiah’s reign. Jeremiah had recorded on a scroll all the terrible disasters that would soon come upon Babylon—all the words written here. He said to Seraiah, “When you get to Babylon, read aloud everything on this scroll. Then say, ‘LORD, you have said that you will destroy Babylon so that neither people nor animals will remain here. She will lie empty and abandoned forever.’ When you have finished reading the scroll, tie it to a stone and throw it into the Euphrates River. Then say, ‘In this same way Babylon and her people will sink, never again to rise, because of the disasters I will bring upon her.’”\nThis is the end of Jeremiah’s messages.",

      "chapter_text": "Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah. But Zedekiah did what was evil in the LORD’s sight, just as Jehoiakim had done. These things happened because of the LORD’s anger against the people of Jerusalem and Judah, until he finally banished them from his presence and sent them into exile.\nZedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. So on January 15, during the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon led his entire army against Jerusalem. They surrounded the city and built siege ramps against its walls. Jerusalem was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah’s reign.\nBy July 18 in the eleventh year of Zedekiah’s reign, the famine in the city had become very severe, and the last of the food was entirely gone. Then a section of the city wall was broken down, and all the soldiers fled. Since the city was surrounded by the Babylonians, they waited for nightfall. Then they slipped through the gate between the two walls behind the king’s garden and headed toward the Jordan Valley.\nBut the Babylonian troops chased King Zedekiah and overtook him on the plains of Jericho, for his men had all deserted him and scattered. They captured the king and took him to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath. There the king of Babylon pronounced judgment upon Zedekiah. The king of Babylon made Zedekiah watch as he slaughtered his sons. He also slaughtered all the officials of Judah at Riblah. Then he gouged out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in bronze chains, and the king of Babylon led him away to Babylon. Zedekiah remained there in prison until the day of his death.\n\nOn August 17 of that year, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard and an official of the Babylonian king, arrived in Jerusalem. He burned down the Temple of the LORD, the royal palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem. He destroyed all the important buildings in the city. Then he supervised the entire Babylonian army as they tore down the walls of Jerusalem on every side. Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took as exiles some of the poorest of the people, the rest of the people who remained in the city, the defectors who had declared their allegiance to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the craftsmen. But Nebuzaradan allowed some of the poorest people to stay behind to care for the vineyards and fields.\nThe Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars in front of the LORD’s Temple, the bronze water carts, and the great bronze basin called the Sea, and they carried all the bronze away to Babylon. They also took all the ash buckets, shovels, lamp snuffers, basins, dishes, and all the other bronze articles used for making sacrifices at the Temple. The captain of the guard also took the small bowls, incense burners, basins, pots, lampstands, ladles, bowls used for liquid offerings, and all the other articles made of pure gold or silver.\nThe weight of the bronze from the two pillars, the Sea with the twelve bronze oxen beneath it, and the water carts was too great to be measured. These things had been made for the LORD’s Temple in the days of King Solomon. Each of the pillars was 27 feet tall and 18 feet in circumference. They were hollow, with walls 3 inches thick. The bronze capital on top of each pillar was 7-1/2 feet high and was decorated with a network of bronze pomegranates all the way around. There were 96 pomegranates on the sides, and a total of 100 pomegranates on the network around the top.\nNebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took with him as prisoners Seraiah the high priest, Zephaniah the priest of the second rank, and the three chief gatekeepers. And from among the people still hiding in the city, he took an officer who had been in charge of the Judean army; seven of the king’s personal advisers; the army commander’s chief secretary, who was in charge of recruitment; and sixty other citizens. Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took them all to the king of Babylon at Riblah. And there at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king of Babylon had them all put to death. So the people of Judah were sent into exile from their land.\nThe number of captives taken to Babylon in the seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign was 3,023. Then in Nebuchadnezzar’s eighteenth year he took 832 more. In Nebuchadnezzar’s twenty-third year he sent Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, who took 745 more—a total of 4,600 captives in all.\n\nIn the thirty-seventh year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah, Evil-merodach ascended to the Babylonian throne. He was kind to Jehoiachin and released him from prison on March 31 of that year. He spoke kindly to Jehoiachin and gave him a higher place than all the other exiled kings in Babylon. He supplied Jehoiachin with new clothes to replace his prison garb and allowed him to dine in the king’s presence for the rest of his life. So the Babylonian king gave him a regular food allowance as long as he lived. This continued until the day of his death.",
