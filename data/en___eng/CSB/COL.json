You have already heard about this hope in the word of truth,  the gospel that has come to you. It is bearing fruit  and growing all over the world,  just as it has among you since the day you heard it and came to truly appreciate  God’s grace.  , You learned this from Epaphras,  our dearly loved fellow servant. He is a faithful minister of Christ  on your  behalf, and he has told us about your love in the Spirit. \n\nFor this reason also, since the day we heard this, we haven’t stopped praying for you. We are asking  that you may be filled with the knowledge  of his will  in all wisdom and spiritual understanding,  so that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him: bearing fruit in every good work  and growing in the knowledge of God,  being strengthened  with all power,  according to his glorious  might, so that you may have great endurance and patience, joyfully giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you  to share in the saints’ inheritance in the light.  He has rescued  us from the domain of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom  of the Son  he loves.  In him we have redemption,  the forgiveness of sins.\n\nHe is the image of the invisible God, \nthe firstborn over all creation. \nFor everything was created by him, \nin heaven and on earth,\nthe visible and the invisible,\nwhether thrones or dominions\nor rulers or authorities —\nall things have been created through him and for him. \nHe is before all things, \nand by him all things  hold together.\nHe is also the head of the body, the church;\nhe is the beginning, \nthe firstborn from the dead, \nso that he might come to have\nfirst place in everything.\nFor God was pleased to have\nall his fullness  dwell in him, \nand through him to reconcile\neverything to himself,\nwhether things on earth or things in heaven,\nby making peace \nthrough his blood,  shed on the cross.  ,\n\nOnce you were alienated and hostile in your minds as expressed in your evil actions. But now he has reconciled you by his physical body through his death,  to present you holy, faultless,  and blameless before him   #— # if indeed you remain grounded and steadfast in the faith  and are not shifted away from the hope  of the gospel that you heard. This gospel has been proclaimed in all creation  under heaven,  and I, Paul,  have become a servant of it.\n\nNow I rejoice in my sufferings  for you, and I am completing in my flesh what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions for his body,  that is, the church. I have become its servant, according to God’s commission that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known, the mystery hidden for ages and generations but now revealed to his saints. God wanted to make known among the Gentiles the glorious wealth of this mystery, which is Christ  in you, the hope  of glory. We proclaim him, warning and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone mature in Christ. I labor for this, striving  with his strength that works powerfully in me.",

I want their hearts to be encouraged  and joined together in love, so that they may have all the riches of complete understanding and have the knowledge of God’s mystery   #— #Christ.  , In him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom  and knowledge. \n\nI am saying this so that no one will deceive you with arguments that sound reasonable. For I may be absent in body, but I am with you in spirit,  rejoicing to see how well ordered you are and the strength of your faith in Christ.\nSo then, just as you have received  Christ Jesus as Lord,  continue to walk in him, being rooted and built up in him  and established in the faith, just as you were taught,  and overflowing with gratitude.\nBe careful that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit based on human tradition,  based on the elements of the world, rather than Christ.  For the entire fullness  of God’s nature dwells bodily  in Christ, and you have been filled by him, who is the head  over every ruler and authority. You were also circumcised in him with a circumcision not done with hands, by putting off the body of flesh,  in the circumcision of Christ,  when you were buried with him  in baptism, in which you were also raised with him  through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.  And when you were dead in trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, he made you alive with him and forgave us all our trespasses. He erased the certificate of debt, with its obligations, that was against us and opposed to us, and has taken it away by nailing it to the cross.  He disarmed the rulers and authorities and disgraced them publicly; he triumphed over them in him.  ,\nTherefore, don’t let anyone judge  you in regard to food and drink  or in the matter of a festival or a new moon  or a Sabbath day.  These are a shadow  of what was to come;  the substance is  Christ.  Let no one condemn  you  by delighting in ascetic practices  and the worship of angels, claiming access to a visionary realm. Such people are inflated  by empty notions of their unspiritual  mind. They don’t hold on to the head, from whom the whole body,  nourished and held together by its ligaments and tendons, grows with growth from God.\nIf you died with Christ  to the elements of this world, why do you live as if you still belonged to the world? Why do you submit to regulations: “Don’t handle, don’t taste, don’t touch”? All these regulations refer to what is destined to perish by being used up; they are human commands and doctrines. Although these have a reputation for wisdom  by promoting self-made religion, false humility, and severe treatment of the body, they are not of any value in curbing self-indulgence.  ,",

When Christ, who is your  life, appears,  then you also will appear with him in glory. \nTherefore, put to death what belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity,  lust,  evil desire, and greed,  which is idolatry.  Because of these, God’s wrath  is coming upon the disobedient,  and you once walked in these things when you were living  in them. But now, put away  all the following: anger,  wrath,  malice,  slander,  and filthy language from your mouth.  Do not lie  to one another, since you have put off  the old self  with its practices and have put on  the new self. You are being renewed in knowledge according to the image of your  Creator.  In Christ there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave and free; but Christ is all and in all. \n\nTherefore, as God’s chosen ones, holy and dearly loved,  put on compassion, kindness,  humility,  gentleness,  and patience,  bearing with one another and forgiving one another if anyone has a grievance against another. Just as the Lord has forgiven you, so you are also to forgive.  Above all, put on love, which is the perfect bond of unity. And let the peace of Christ, to which you were also called  in one body, rule your hearts. And be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell richly among you, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another through psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs,  singing to God with gratitude in your hearts. And whatever you do, in word or in deed, do everything in the name  of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.\n\nWives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.  Husbands,  love your wives  and don’t be bitter  toward them. Children,  obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord. Fathers,  do not exasperate  your children, so that they won’t become discouraged. Slaves, obey your human  masters in everything. Don’t work only while being watched, as people-pleasers, but work wholeheartedly, fearing the Lord.  Whatever you do, do it from the heart, as something done for the Lord and not for people,  knowing that you will receive the reward of an inheritance from the Lord. You serve the Lord Christ. For the wrongdoer  will be paid back for whatever wrong he has done, and there is no favoritism.",

These alone of the circumcised are my coworkers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me. Epaphras,  who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, sends you greetings. He is always wrestling  for you in his prayers, so that you can stand mature and fully assured  in everything God wills.  For I testify about him that he works hard  , for you, for those in Laodicea,  and for those in Hierapolis. Luke, the dearly loved physician, and Demas  send you greetings. Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters in Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her home.  After this letter has been read at your gathering, have it read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and see that you also read the letter from Laodicea. And tell Archippus,  “Pay attention to the ministry you have received in the Lord, so that you can accomplish it.” \nI, Paul, am writing this greeting with my own hand.
