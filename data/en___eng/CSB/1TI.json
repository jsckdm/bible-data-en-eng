      "chapter_text": "Paul,  an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command  of God our Savior  and of Christ Jesus our hope: \nTo Timothy,  my true son in the faith.\nGrace, mercy, and peace from God the  Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.\n\nAs I urged you when I went to Macedonia,  remain in Ephesus  so that you may instruct certain people  not to teach false doctrine or to pay attention to myths  and endless genealogies. These promote empty speculations rather than God’s plan,  which operates by faith. Now the goal of our instruction is love  that comes from a pure heart,  a good conscience,  and a sincere faith.  Some have departed from these and turned aside to fruitless discussion. They want to be teachers of the law, although they don’t understand what they are saying or what they are insisting on. But we know that the law is good,  provided one uses it legitimately. We know that the law is not meant for a righteous person, but for the lawless and rebellious,  for the ungodly and sinful, for the unholy and irreverent, for those who kill their fathers and mothers, for murderers, for the sexually immoral  and males who have sex with males,  for slave traders, liars,  perjurers, and for whatever else is contrary to the sound teaching  that conforms to the gospel  concerning the glory of the blessed God,  which was entrusted to me. \n\nI give thanks to Christ Jesus our Lord who has strengthened  me, because he considered me faithful, appointing me to the ministry #— # even though I was formerly a blasphemer,  a persecutor,  and an arrogant man.  But I received mercy because I acted out of ignorance in unbelief, and the grace of our Lord overflowed, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. This saying is trustworthy  and deserving of full acceptance: “Christ Jesus came into the world  to save sinners”   #— #and I am the worst of them.  But I received mercy  for this reason, so that in me, the worst of them, Christ Jesus might demonstrate his extraordinary patience  as an example to those who would believe in him for eternal life.  Now to the King  eternal,  immortal,  invisible, the only  God,  be honor  and glory  forever and ever. Amen. \n\nTimothy, my son, I am giving you this instruction in keeping with the prophecies  previously made about you, so that by recalling them you may fight the good fight, having faith  and a good conscience,  which some  have rejected and have shipwrecked the faith. Among them are Hymenaeus  and Alexander,  whom I have delivered to Satan,  so that they may be taught not to blaspheme.",

(If anyone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of God’s church?) He must not be a new convert, or he might become conceited and incur the same condemnation as the devil.  Furthermore, he must have a good reputation among outsiders, so that he does not fall into disgrace and the devil’s  trap.\nDeacons,  likewise, should be worthy of respect, not hypocritical, not drinking a lot of wine, not greedy for money, holding the mystery of the faith  with a clear conscience.  They must also be tested first; if they prove blameless, then they can serve as deacons. Wives,  , likewise, should be worthy of respect, not slanderers, self-controlled,  faithful in everything. Deacons are to be husbands of one wife, managing their children and their own households competently.

      "chapter_text": "Don’t rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father, younger men as brothers, older women as mothers, and the younger women as sisters with all purity.\n\nSupport  widows  who are genuinely in need. But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn to practice godliness toward their own family first and to repay their parents, for this pleases God. The widow who is truly in need and left all alone has put her hope in God  and continues night and day in her petitions and prayers; however, she who is self-indulgent is dead even while she lives.  Command this also, so that they will be above reproach. But if anyone does not provide  for his own family, especially for his own household, he has denied the faith  and is worse than an unbeliever.\nNo widow is to be enrolled on the list for support unless she is at least sixty years old, has been the wife of one husband, and is well known for good works   #— #that is, if she has brought up children, shown hospitality,  washed the saints’ feet,  helped the afflicted,  and devoted herself to every good work.  But refuse to enroll younger widows, for when they are drawn away from Christ by desire, they want to marry  and will therefore receive condemnation  because they have renounced their original pledge. At the same time, they also learn to be idle, going from house to house; they are not only idle, but are also gossips  and busybodies, saying things they shouldn’t say. Therefore, I want younger women to marry,  have children, manage their households, and give the adversary no opportunity to accuse us.  For some have already turned away  to follow Satan. If any  believing woman has widows in her family, let her help them. Let the church not be burdened, so that it can help widows in genuine need.\n\nThe elders who are good leaders are to be considered worthy of double honor,  especially those who work hard  at preaching and teaching. For the Scripture says: Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,   , and, “The worker is worthy of his wages.”  \nDon’t accept an accusation against an elder unless it is supported by two or three witnesses.  Publicly rebuke those who sin, so that the rest will be afraid. I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels to observe  these things without prejudice, doing nothing out of favoritism. Don’t be too quick to appoint  , anyone as an elder, and don’t share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure.  Don’t continue drinking only water, but use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses. Some people’s sins are obvious, preceding them to judgment,  but the sins of others surface  later. Likewise, good works are obvious, and those that are not obvious cannot remain hidden.",

Let those who have believing masters not be disrespectful to them because they are brothers, but serve them even better, since those who benefit from their service are believers and dearly loved.  ,\n\nTeach and encourage these things. If anyone teaches false doctrine and does not agree with the sound teaching of our Lord  Jesus Christ and with the teaching that promotes godliness,  he is conceited and understands nothing, but has an unhealthy interest in disputes and arguments over words.  From these come envy,  quarreling,  slander,  evil suspicions, and constant disagreement among people whose minds are depraved and deprived of the truth, who imagine that godliness is a way to material gain.  , But godliness with contentment is great gain.  For we brought nothing into the world, and  we can take nothing out.  If we have food and clothing,  we will be content with these. But those who want to be rich fall into temptation, a trap, and many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root  of all kinds of evil, and by craving it, some have wandered away from the faith  and pierced themselves with many griefs.\n\nBut you, man of God, flee from these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love,  endurance,  and gentleness. Fight the good fight  of the faith. Take hold of eternal life  to which you were called and about which you have made a good confession in the presence of many witnesses. In the presence of God, who gives life to all,  and of Christ Jesus, who gave a good confession before Pontius Pilate,  I charge you to keep this command without fault or failure until the appearing  of our Lord  Jesus Christ. God will bring this about in his own time.  He is the blessed and only  Sovereign, the King of kings,  and the Lord of lords,  who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light,  whom no one has seen or can see,  to him be honor and eternal power.  Amen. \n\nInstruct those who are rich in the present age not to be arrogant  or to set their hope on the uncertainty of wealth, but on God,  who richly provides us with all things  to enjoy. Instruct them to do what is good, to be rich in good works,  to be generous and willing to share,  storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the coming age,  so that they may take hold of what is truly life.\n\nTimothy, guard what has been entrusted to you,  avoiding  irreverent and empty speech and contradictions from what is falsely called knowledge.  By professing it, some  people have departed from the faith. \nGrace be with you all.",
