Everything is futile.” \nWhat does a person gain for all his efforts\nthat he labors at under the sun? \nA generation goes and a generation comes,\nbut the earth remains forever. \nThe sun rises and the sun sets;\npanting, it hurries back to the place \nwhere it rises.\nGusting to the south,\nturning to the north,\nturning, turning, goes the wind, \nand the wind returns in its cycles.\nAll the streams flow to the sea,\nyet the sea is never full;\nto the place where the streams flow,\nthere they flow again.\nAll things  are wearisome,\nmore than anyone can say.\nThe eye is not satisfied by seeing \nor the ear filled with hearing.\nWhat has been is what will be,\nand what has been done is what will be done;\nthere is nothing new under the sun.\nCan one say about anything,\n“Look, this is new”?\nIt has already existed in the ages before us.\nThere is no remembrance of those who   came before; \nand of those who will come after\nthere will also be no remembrance\nby those who follow them.\n\nI, the Teacher,  have been  king over Israel in Jerusalem. I applied my mind to examine  and explore through wisdom all that is done under heaven.  God has given people  this miserable task to keep them occupied.  I have seen all the things that are done under the sun and have found everything to be futile, a pursuit of the wind.  ,\nWhat is crooked cannot be straightened; \nwhat is lacking cannot be counted.\n\nI said to myself, “See, I have amassed wisdom far beyond all those who were over Jerusalem before me,  and my mind has thoroughly grasped  wisdom and knowledge.” I applied my mind to know wisdom and knowledge,  madness and folly;  I learned that this too is a pursuit of the wind. \nFor with much wisdom is much sorrow; \nas knowledge increases, grief increases.",

      "chapter_text": "I said to myself, “Go ahead, I will test you with pleasure;  enjoy what is good.” But it turned out to be futile. I said about laughter,  “It is madness,” and about pleasure, “What does this accomplish? ” I explored with my mind the pull of wine  on my body #— #my mind still guiding me with wisdom — and how to grasp folly,  until I could see what is good for people to do under heaven  during the few days of their lives. \n\nI increased my achievements. I built houses  and planted vineyards  for myself. I made gardens  and parks for myself and planted every kind of fruit tree in them. I constructed reservoirs for myself from which to irrigate a grove of flourishing trees.  I acquired male and female servants and had slaves who were born in my house.  I also owned livestock #— #large herds and flocks #— #more than all who were before me in Jerusalem.  I also amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces.  I gathered male and female singers for myself,  and many concubines, the delights of men.  , So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem;  my wisdom also remained with me. All that my eyes desired, I did not deny them.  I did not refuse myself any pleasure, for I took pleasure in all my struggles. This was my reward for all my struggles.  When I considered all that I had accomplished  and what I had labored to achieve, I found everything to be futile and a pursuit of the wind.  , There was nothing to be gained under the sun. \n\nThen I turned to consider wisdom,  madness, and folly, for what will the king’s successor  be like? He  will do what has already been done.  And I realized that there is an advantage to wisdom over folly, like the advantage of light over darkness. \nThe wise person has eyes in his head,\nbut the fool walks in darkness. \nYet I also knew that one fate comes to them both.  So I said to myself, “What happens to the fool will also happen to me. Why then have I been overly wise? ”  And I said to myself that this is also futile. For, just like the fool, there is no lasting remembrance of the wise,  since in the days to come both will be forgotten. How is it that the wise person dies just like the fool? Therefore, I hated life because the work that was done under the sun was distressing to me. For everything is futile and a pursuit of the wind.\n\nI hated all my work that I labored at under the sun  because I must leave it to the one who comes after me.  And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool?  Yet he will take over all my work that I labored at skillfully under the sun. This too is futile. So I began to give myself over  to despair concerning all my work that I had labored at under the sun. When there is a person whose work was done with wisdom, knowledge, and skill,  and he must give his portion to a person who has not worked for it, this too is futile and a great wrong. For what does a person get with all his work and all his efforts  that he labors at under the sun? For all his days are filled with grief, and his occupation is sorrowful;  even at night, his mind does not rest.  This too is futile.\nThere is nothing better for a person than to eat, drink, and enjoy  , his work.  I have seen that even this is from God’s hand,  because who can eat and who can enjoy life  apart from him?  For to the person who is pleasing in his sight, he gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy;  but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and accumulating in order to give to the one who is pleasing in God’s sight.  This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.",

It is also the gift of God whenever anyone eats, drinks, and enjoys all his efforts.  I know that everything God does will last forever; there is no adding to it or taking from it.  God works so that people will be in awe of him.  Whatever is, has already been,  and whatever will be, already is. However, God seeks justice for the persecuted. \n\nI also observed under the sun: there is wickedness at the place of judgment and there is wickedness at the place of righteousness.  I said to myself, “God will judge the righteous and the wicked,  since there is a time for every activity and every work.”  I said to myself, “This happens so that God may test the children of Adam and they may see for themselves that they are like animals.”  For the fate of the children of Adam and the fate of animals is the same.  As one dies, so dies the other; they all have the same breath. People have no advantage over animals since everything is futile. All are going to the same place; all come from dust, and all return to dust.  Who knows if the spirits of the children of Adam go upward and the spirits of animals go downward to the earth? I have seen that there is nothing better than for a person to enjoy his activities  because that is his reward. For who can enable him to see what will happen after he dies?  ,",

For if either falls, his companion can lift him up; but pity the one who falls without another to lift him up. Also, if two lie down together, they can keep warm; but how can one person alone keep warm?  And if someone overpowers one person, two can resist him. A cord of three strands is not easily broken.\nBetter is a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer pays attention to warnings.  For he came from prison to be king,  even though he was born poor in his kingdom. I saw all the living, who move about under the sun, follow  a second youth who succeeds him. There is no limit to all the people who were before them, yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.",

Do not be hasty to speak, and do not be impulsive to make a speech before God. God is in heaven and you are on earth, so let your words be few.  Just as dreams accompany much labor, so also a fool’s voice comes with many words.  When you make a vow to God,  don’t delay fulfilling it, because he does not delight in fools. Fulfill what you vow. Better that you do not vow than that you vow and not fulfill it.  Do not let your mouth bring guilt on you,  and do not say in the presence of the messenger that it was a mistake.  Why should God be angry with your words and destroy the work of your hands? For many dreams bring futility; so do many words.  Therefore, fear God.\n\nIf you see oppression of the poor  and perversion of justice and righteousness in the province, don’t be astonished at the situation,  because one official protects another official, and higher officials protect them. The profit from the land is taken by all; the king is served by the field.  ,\nThe one who loves silver is never satisfied with silver, and whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with income. This too is futile. When good things increase, the ones who consume them multiply; what, then, is the profit to the owner, except to gaze at them with his eyes? The sleep of the worker is sweet, whether he eats little or much, but the abundance of the rich permits him no sleep.\nThere is a sickening tragedy I have seen under the sun: wealth kept by its owner to his harm.  That wealth was lost in a bad venture, so when he fathered a son, he was empty-handed. As he came from his mother’s womb, so he will go again, naked as he came;  he will take nothing for his efforts that he can carry in his hands. This too is a sickening tragedy: exactly as he comes, so he will go. What does the one gain  who struggles for the wind?  What is more, he eats in darkness all his days,  with much frustration, sickness, and anger.\nHere is what I have seen to be good:  It is appropriate to eat, drink, and experience good in all the labor one does under the sun during the few days of his life God has given him, because that is his reward.  Furthermore, everyone to whom God has given riches and wealth,  he has also allowed him to enjoy them, take his reward, and rejoice in his labor.  This is a gift of God,  for he does not often consider the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with the joy of his heart.",

Instead, a stranger will enjoy them. This is futile and a sickening tragedy. A man may father a hundred children and live many years. No matter how long he lives,  if he is not satisfied by good things and does not even have a proper burial,  I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.  For he comes in futility and he goes in darkness, and his name is shrouded in darkness. Though a stillborn child does not see the sun and is not conscious, it has more rest than he. And if a person lives a thousand years twice, but does not experience happiness, do not both go to the same place?\nAll of a person’s labor is for his stomach,  ,\nyet the appetite is never satisfied.\n\nWhat advantage then does the wise person have over the fool?  What advantage is there for the poor person who knows how to conduct himself before others? Better what the eyes see than wandering desire.  This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.  ,\nWhatever exists was given its name long ago,  , and it is known what mankind is. But he is not able to contend with the one stronger than he.  For when there are many words, they increase futility.  What is the advantage for mankind? For who knows what is good for anyone in life, in the few days of his futile life that he spends like a shadow?  Who can tell anyone what will happen after him under the sun?",

Don’t be excessively wicked, and don’t be foolish. Why should you die before your time?  It is good that you grasp the one and do not let the other slip from your hand. For the one who fears God will end up with both of them.\nWisdom makes the wise person stronger\nthan ten rulers of a city. \nThere is certainly no one righteous on the earth\nwho does good and never sins. \n\nDon’t pay attention  to everything people say, or you may hear your servant cursing you,  for in your heart you know that many times you yourself have cursed others.\n\nI have tested all this by wisdom. I resolved, “I will be wise,” but it was beyond me. What exists is beyond reach and very deep.  Who can discover it? I turned my thoughts to know, explore, and examine wisdom  and an explanation for things, and to know that wickedness is stupidity and folly is madness. And I find more bitter than death  the woman who is a trap:  her heart a net and her hands chains. The one who pleases God will escape her, but the sinner will be captured by her. “Look,” says the Teacher, “I have discovered this by adding one thing to another to find out the explanation, which my soul continually searches for but does not find: I found one person in a thousand, but none of those was a woman.  Only see this: I have discovered that God made people upright,  but they pursued many schemes.”",

A person’s wisdom brightens his face, and the sternness of his face is changed. \nKeep  the king’s command because of your oath made before God.  Do not be in a hurry; leave his presence,  and don’t persist in a bad cause, since he will do whatever he wants. For the king’s word is authoritative, and who can say to him, “What are you doing? ”  The one who keeps a command will not experience anything harmful,  and a wise heart knows the right time and procedure. For every activity there is a right time and procedure,  even though a person’s troubles are heavy on him. Yet no one knows what will happen  because who can tell him what will happen? No one has authority over the wind  to restrain it,  and there is no authority over the day of death;  no one is discharged during battle, and wickedness will not allow those who practice it to escape. All this I have seen, applying my mind to all the work that is done under the sun, at a time when one person has authority over another to his harm.\nIn such circumstances, I saw the wicked buried. They came and went from the holy place,  and they were praised  in the city where they did those things. This too is futile. Because the sentence against an evil act is not carried out quickly,  the heart of people is filled with the desire to commit evil. Although a sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his life,  I also know that it will go well with God-fearing people,  for they are reverent before him. However, it will not go well with the wicked,  and they will not lengthen their days like a shadow,  for they are not reverent before God.\nThere is a futility that is done on the earth: there are righteous people who get what the actions of the wicked deserve,  and there are wicked people who get what the actions of the righteous deserve.  I say that this too is futile. So I commended enjoyment because there is nothing better for a person under the sun than to eat, drink, and enjoy himself,  for this will accompany him in his labor during the days of his life that God gives him under the sun.\nWhen I applied my mind to know wisdom  and to observe the activity that is done on the earth (even though one’s eyes do not close in sleep day or night), I observed all the work of God and concluded that a person is unable to discover the work that is done under the sun. Even though a person labors hard to explore it, he cannot find it;  even if a wise person claims to know it, he is unable to discover it.",

Everything lies ahead of them. Everything is the same for everyone:  There is one fate for the righteous and the wicked,  for the good and the bad,  for the clean and the unclean, for the one who sacrifices and the one who does not sacrifice. As it is for the good, so also it is for the sinner; as it is for the one who takes an oath, so also for the one who fears an oath. This is an evil in all that is done under the sun: there is one fate for everyone. In addition, the hearts of people are full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live;  after that they go to the dead. But there is hope for whoever is joined  with all the living, since a live dog is better than a dead lion. For the living know that they will die, but the dead don’t know anything. There is no longer a reward for them because the memory of them is forgotten.  Their love, their hate, and their envy have already disappeared, and there is no longer a portion for them in all that is done under the sun.\nGo, eat your bread with pleasure, and drink your wine with a cheerful heart, for God has already accepted your works.  Let your clothes be white all the time, and never let oil be lacking on your head.  Enjoy life with the wife you love all the days of your fleeting  life,  which has been given to you under the sun, all your fleeting days. For that is your portion in life and in your struggle  under the sun. Whatever your hands find to do, do with all your strength,  because there is no work, planning, knowledge, or wisdom  in Sheol where you are going.\n\nAgain I saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift,  or the battle to the strong,  or bread to the wise, or riches to the discerning, or favor to the skillful; rather, time and chance happen to all of them. For certainly no one knows his time:  like fish caught in a cruel net or like birds caught in a trap,  so people are trapped in an evil time  as it suddenly falls on them. \nI have observed that this also is wisdom under the sun, and it is significant to me: There was a small city with few men in it. A great king came against it, surrounded it, and built large siege works against it. Now a poor wise man was found in the city,  and he delivered the city by his wisdom.  Yet no one remembered that poor man. And I said, “Wisdom is better than strength,  but the wisdom of the poor man is despised, and his words are not heeded.”\nThe calm words of the wise are heeded\nmore than the shouts of a ruler over fools.\nWisdom is better than weapons of war,\nbut one sinner can destroy much good.",
