      "chapter_text": "The word of the LORD came to Jonah son of Amittai:  “Get up!  Go to the great city  of Nineveh  and preach against it  because their evil  has come up before me.”  Jonah got up to flee to Tarshish  from the LORD’s presence.  He went down  to Joppa  and found a ship going to Tarshish. He paid the fare and went down into it to go with them to Tarshish from the LORD’s presence.\nBut the LORD threw  a great wind onto the sea,  and such a great storm arose on the sea that the ship threatened to break apart. The sailors were afraid, and each cried out to his god.  They threw the ship’s cargo into the sea to lighten the load.  Meanwhile, Jonah had gone down to the lowest part of the vessel and had stretched out and fallen into a deep sleep. \nThe captain approached him and said, “What are you doing sound asleep? Get up! Call to your god.  , Maybe this god will consider us,  and we won’t perish.”\n“Come on! ” the sailors said to each other. “Let’s cast lots.  Then we’ll know who is to blame for this trouble we’re in.” So they cast lots, and the lot singled out Jonah.  Then they said to him, “Tell us who is to blame for this trouble we’re in.  What is your business,  and where are you from? What is your country, and what people are you from? ”\nHe answered them, “I’m a Hebrew.  I worship  the LORD,  the God of the heavens,  who made the sea  and the dry land.”\nThen the men were seized by a great fear and said to him, “What have you done? ” The men knew he was fleeing from the LORD’s presence  because he had told them. So they said to him, “What should we do to you so that the sea will calm down for us? ” For the sea was getting worse and worse.\nHe answered them, “Pick me up and throw me into the sea so that it will calm down for you, for I know that I’m to blame  for this great storm that is against you.” Nevertheless, the men rowed hard to get back to dry land, but they couldn’t because the sea was raging against them more and more.\nSo they called out to the LORD,  “Please, LORD, don’t let us perish because of this man’s life, and don’t charge us with innocent blood! For you, LORD, have done just as you pleased.”  Then they picked up Jonah and threw him into the sea, and the sea stopped its raging.  The men were seized by great fear of the LORD,  and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD and made vows. \nThe LORD appointed a great fish  to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.",

That’s why I fled toward Tarshish in the first place.  I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God,  slow to anger, abounding in faithful love, and one who relents from sending disaster.  And now, LORD, take my life from me,  for it is better for me to die than to live.” \nThe LORD asked, “Is it right for you to be angry? ”\nJonah left the city and found a place east of it.  He made himself a shelter there and sat in its shade to see what would happen to the city. Then the LORD God appointed a plant, and it grew over Jonah to provide shade for his head to rescue him from his trouble.  Jonah was greatly pleased with the plant. When dawn came the next day, God appointed a worm that attacked the plant, and it withered. \nAs the sun was rising, God appointed a scorching east wind.  The sun beat down on Jonah’s head  so much that he almost fainted, and he wanted to die. He said, “It’s better for me to die than to live.” \nThen God asked Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about the plant? ”\n“Yes, it’s right! ” he replied. “I’m angry enough to die! ”\nAnd the LORD said, “You cared about the plant, which you did not labor over and did not grow. It appeared in a night and perished in a night. So may I not care about the great city of Nineveh,  which has more than a hundred twenty thousand people who cannot distinguish between their right and their left,  as well as many animals? ”",
