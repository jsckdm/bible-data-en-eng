      "chapter_text": "The words of Nehemiah  son of Hacaliah:\n\nDuring the month of Chislev  in the twentieth year,  when I was in the fortress city of Susa,  Hanani,  one of my brothers, arrived with men from Judah, and I questioned them about Jerusalem and the Jewish remnant  that had survived the exile.  They said to me, “The remnant in the province,  who survived the exile, are in great trouble and disgrace. Jerusalem’s wall has been broken down, and its gates have been burned.” \n\nWhen I heard these words, I sat down and wept. I mourned for a number of days, fasting and praying  before the God of the heavens.  I said, \nLORD, the God of the heavens, the great and awe-inspiring God who keeps his gracious covenant with those who love him  and keep his commands,  let your eyes be open and your ears be attentive  to hear your servant’s prayer that I now pray to you day and night  for your servants, the Israelites. I confess the sins  we have committed against you. Both I and my father’s family have sinned.  We have acted corruptly toward you and have not kept the commands, statutes, and ordinances you gave your servant Moses.  Please remember what you commanded your servant Moses: “If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the peoples.  But if you return to me and carefully observe my commands, even though your exiles were banished to the farthest horizon,  I will gather them from there and bring them to the place where I chose to have my name dwell.”  They are your servants and your people. You redeemed them by your great power and strong hand.  Please, Lord, let your ear be attentive  to the prayer of your servant and to that of your servants who delight to revere your name. Give your servant success today,  and grant him compassion in the presence of this man.  ,\nAt the time, I was the king’s cupbearer.",

      "chapter_text": "During the month of Nisan in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes,  when wine was set before him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had never been sad in his presence, so the king said to me, “Why do you look so sad,  when you aren’t sick? This is nothing but sadness of heart.” \nI was overwhelmed with fear and replied to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should I  not be sad when the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins and its gates have been destroyed by fire? ” \nThen the king asked me, “What is your request? ”\nSo I prayed to the God of the heavens  and answered the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor with you, send me to Judah and to the city where my ancestors are buried,  , so that I may rebuild it.” \nThe king, with the queen seated beside him, asked me, “How long will your journey take, and when will you return? ” So I gave him a definite time,  and it pleased the king to send me.\nI also said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let me have letters written to the governors of the region west of the Euphrates River,  so that they will grant me safe passage until I reach Judah.  And let me have a letter written to Asaph, keeper of the king’s forest, so that he will give me timber to rebuild the gates of the temple’s fortress,  the city wall, and the home where I will live.”  , The king granted my requests, for the gracious hand of my God was on me. \nI went to the governors of the region west of the Euphrates and gave them the king’s letters.  The king had also sent officers of the infantry and cavalry with me. When Sanballat the Horonite  and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard that someone had come to pursue the prosperity of the Israelites, they were greatly displeased. \n\nAfter I arrived in Jerusalem and had been there three days,  I got up at night and took a few men with me. I didn’t tell anyone what my God had laid on my heart to do for Jerusalem. The only animal I took  was the one I was riding. I went out at night through the Valley Gate toward the Serpent’s  Well and the Dung Gate,  and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem that had been broken down and its gates that had been destroyed by fire.  I went on to the Fountain Gate  and the King’s Pool,  but farther down it became too narrow for my animal to go through. So I went up at night by way of the valley and inspected the wall. Then heading back, I entered through the Valley Gate  and returned. The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, for I had not yet told the Jews, priests, nobles, officials, or the rest of those who would be doing the work. So I said to them, “You see the trouble we are in. Jerusalem lies in ruins and its gates have been burned.  Come, let’s rebuild Jerusalem’s wall,  so that we will no longer be a disgrace.” I told them how the gracious hand of my God had been on me,  and what the king had said to me.\nThey said, “Let’s start rebuilding,” and their hands were strengthened  to do this good work.\nWhen Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official,  and Geshem the Arab  heard about this, they mocked and despised us, and said, “What is this you’re doing? Are you rebelling against the king? ”\nI gave them this reply, “The God of the heavens is the one who will grant us success.

      "chapter_text": "When Sanballat  heard that we were rebuilding the wall,  he became furious. He mocked the Jews  before his colleagues and the powerful men  of Samaria  and said, “What are these pathetic Jews doing? Can they restore it by themselves? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they ever finish it? Can they bring these burnt stones  back to life from the mounds of rubble? ”  Then Tobiah the Ammonite,  who was beside him, said, “Indeed, even if a fox  climbed up what they are building, he would break down their stone wall! ”\nListen, our God, for we are despised. Make their insults return on their own heads and let them be taken as plunder to a land of captivity. Do not cover their guilt or let their sin be erased from your sight, because they have angered  the builders. \nSo we rebuilt the wall until the entire wall was joined together up to half its height, for the people had the will to keep working. \nWhen Sanballat, Tobiah, and the Arabs,  Ammonites, and Ashdodites heard that the repair to the walls of Jerusalem was progressing and that the gaps were being closed,  they became furious.  They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and throw it into confusion. So we prayed to our God and stationed a guard because of them day and night.\nIn Judah, it was said: \nThe strength of the laborer fails,\nsince there is so much rubble.\nWe will never be able\nto rebuild the wall.\n\nAnd our enemies said, “They won’t realize it  until we’re among them and can kill them and stop the work.” When the Jews who lived nearby arrived, they said to us time and again,  “Everywhere you turn, they attack  us.” So I stationed people behind the lowest sections of the wall, at the vulnerable areas. I stationed them by families with their swords, spears, and bows. After I made an inspection, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people,  “Don’t be afraid of them.  Remember the great and awe-inspiring Lord, and fight for your countrymen, your sons and daughters, your wives and homes.” \n\nWhen our enemies heard that we knew their scheme and that God had frustrated it, every one of us returned to his own work on the wall. From that day on, half of my men did the work while the other half held spears, shields, bows, and armor.  The officers supported all the people of Judah, who were rebuilding the wall. The laborers who carried the loads worked with one hand and held a weapon with the other. Each of the builders had his sword strapped around his waist while he was building, and the one who sounded the ram’s horn was beside me. Then I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people,  “The work is enormous and spread out, and we are separated far from one another along the wall.  Wherever you hear the sound of the ram’s horn, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us! ”  So we continued the work, while half of the men were holding spears from daybreak until the stars came out. At that time, I also said to the people, “Let everyone and his servant spend the night inside Jerusalem, so that they can stand guard by night and work by day.” And I, my brothers, my servants, and the men of the guard with me never took off our clothes. Each carried his weapon, even when washing.",

      "chapter_text": "There was a widespread outcry from the people and their wives against their Jewish countrymen. Some were saying, “We, our sons, and our daughters are numerous. Let us get grain so that we can eat and live.” Others were saying, “We are mortgaging our fields, vineyards, and homes to get grain during the famine.”  Still others were saying, “We have borrowed money to pay the king’s tax  on our fields and vineyards.  We and our children are just like our countrymen and their children, yet we are subjecting our sons and daughters to slavery.  Some of our daughters are already enslaved,  but we are powerless  because our fields and vineyards belong to others.”\nI became extremely angry  when I heard their outcry and these complaints. After seriously considering the matter, I accused the nobles and officials, saying to them, “Each of you is charging his countrymen interest.”  So I called a large assembly against them and said, “We have done our best to buy back our Jewish countrymen who were sold to foreigners, but now you sell your own countrymen, and we have to buy them back.”  They remained silent and could not say a word.  Then I said, “What you are doing isn’t right. Shouldn’t you walk in the fear of our God  and not invite the reproach of our foreign enemies?  Even I, as well as my brothers and my servants, have been lending them money and grain. Please, let’s stop charging this interest.  Return their fields, vineyards, olive groves, and houses to them immediately, along with the percentage  of the money, grain, new wine, and fresh oil  that you have been assessing them.”\nThey responded, “We will return these things and require nothing more from them.  We will do as you say.”\nSo I summoned the priests and made everyone take an oath  to do this. I also shook the folds of my robe and said, “May God likewise shake from his house and property everyone who doesn’t keep this promise. May he be shaken out  and have nothing! ”\nThe whole assembly said, “Amen,” and they praised the LORD. Then the people did as they had promised. \n\nFurthermore, from the day King Artaxerxes  appointed me to be their governor in the land of Judah #— #from the twentieth year until his thirty-second year, twelve years   #— #I and my associates never ate from the food allotted to the governor. The governors  who preceded me had heavily burdened the people, taking from them food and wine as well as a pound  of silver. Their subordinates also oppressed the people, but because of the fear of God, I didn’t do this.  Instead, I devoted myself to the construction of this wall,  and all my subordinates were gathered there for the work. We didn’t buy any land. \nThere were 150 Jews and officials, as well as guests from the surrounding nations at my table.  Each  day, one ox, six choice sheep, and some fowl were prepared for me. An abundance of all kinds of wine was provided every ten days.  But I didn’t demand the food allotted to the governor, because the burden on the people was so heavy.\nRemember me favorably, my God, for all that I have done for this people.",

Why should the work cease while I leave it and go down to you? ” Four times they sent me the same proposal, and I gave them the same reply.\nSanballat  sent me this same message a fifth time by his aide, who had an open letter in his hand. In it was written:\nIt is reported among the nations #— #and Geshem  , agrees #— #that you and the Jews plan to rebel. This is the reason you are building the wall. According to these reports, you are to become their king and have even set up the prophets in Jerusalem to proclaim on your behalf, “There is a king in Judah.”  These rumors will be heard by the king. So come, let’s confer together.\n\nThen I replied to him, “There is nothing to these rumors you are spreading; you are inventing them in your own mind.”  For they were all trying to intimidate  us, saying, “They will drop their hands from  the work,  and it will never be finished.”\nBut now, my God, strengthen my hands. \n\nI went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was restricted to his house. He said:\nLet’s meet at the house of God,\ninside the temple.\nLet’s shut the temple doors\nbecause they’re coming to kill you.\nThey’re coming to kill you tonight! \nBut I said, “Should a man like me run away? How can someone like me enter the temple and live?  I will not go.” I realized that God had not sent him, because of the prophecy he spoke against me. Tobiah and Sanballat  had hired him. He was hired, so that I would be intimidated,  do as he suggested, sin, and get a bad reputation, in order that they could discredit me.\nMy God, remember  Tobiah and Sanballat for what they have done, and also the prophetess Noadiah  and the other prophets who wanted to intimidate me.\n\nThe wall was completed  in fifty-two days, on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul.  When all our enemies  heard this, all the surrounding nations were intimidated  and lost their confidence,  for they realized that this task had been accomplished by our God. \nDuring those days, the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah,  and Tobiah’s letters came to them. For many in Judah were bound by oath  to him, since he was a son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam  son of Berechiah. These nobles kept mentioning Tobiah’s good deeds to me, and they reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate  me.",

Then I put my brother Hanani  in charge of Jerusalem,  along with Hananiah,  commander of the fortress,  because he was a faithful man who feared God  more than most. I said to them, “Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun is hot, and let the doors be shut and securely fastened while the guards are on duty. Station the citizens of Jerusalem as guards, some at their posts and some at their homes.” \nThe city was large and spacious, but there were few people in it, and no houses had been built yet.  Then my God put it into my mind  to assemble the nobles, the officials, and the people to be registered by genealogy. I found the genealogical record of those who came back first, and I found the following written in it: \nThese are the people of the province who went up among the captive exiles deported by King Nebuchadnezzar  of Babylon. Each of them returned to Jerusalem and Judah, to his own town.  They came with Zerubbabel,  Jeshua,  Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah.\nThe number of the Israelite men included \nParosh’s descendants  2,172\nShephatiah’s descendants 372\nArah’s descendants 652\nPahath-moab’s descendants:\nJeshua’s and Joab’s descendants 2,818\nElam’s descendants 1,254\nZattu’s descendants 845\nZaccai’s descendants 760\nBinnui’s descendants 648\nBebai’s descendants 628\nAzgad’s descendants 2,322\nAdonikam’s descendants  667\nBigvai’s descendants 2,067\nAdin’s descendants  655\nAter’s descendants: of Hezekiah 98\nHashum’s descendants 328\nBezai’s descendants 324\nHariph’s descendants 112\nGibeon’s   descendants 95\nBethlehem’s  and Netophah’s  men 188\nAnathoth’s   men 128\nBeth-azmaveth’s men 42\nKiriath-jearim’s, Chephirah’s, and Beeroth’s men 743\nRamah’s and Geba’s men 621\nMichmas’s men 122\nBethel’s and Ai’s men  123\nthe other Nebo’s men 52\nthe other Elam’s people 1,254\nHarim’s people 320\nJericho’s people  345\nLod’s,  Hadid’s, and Ono’s people 721\nSenaah’s people 3,930 .\n\nThe priests included\nJedaiah’s   descendants of the house of Jeshua 973\nImmer’s descendants 1,052\nPashhur’s descendants 1,247\nHarim’s descendants 1,017 .\n\nThe Levites  included\nJeshua’s descendants: of Kadmiel\nHodevah’s descendants 74 .\n\nThe singers  included\nAsaph’s descendants 148 .\n\nThe gatekeepers  included\nShallum’s descendants, Ater’s descendants,\nTalmon’s descendants, Akkub’s descendants,\nHatita’s descendants, Shobai’s descendants 138 .\n\nThe temple servants  included\nZiha’s descendants, Hasupha’s descendants,\nTabbaoth’s descendants, Keros’s descendants,\nSia’s descendants, Padon’s descendants,\nLebanah’s descendants, Hagabah’s descendants,\nShalmai’s descendants, Hanan’s descendants,\nGiddel’s descendants, Gahar’s descendants,\nReaiah’s descendants, Rezin’s descendants,\nNekoda’s descendants, Gazzam’s descendants,\nUzza’s descendants, Paseah’s descendants,\nBesai’s descendants, Meunim’s descendants,\nNephishesim’s   descendants, Bakbuk’s descendants,\nHakupha’s descendants, Harhur’s descendants,\nBazlith’s descendants, Mehida’s descendants,\nHarsha’s descendants, Barkos’s descendants,\nSisera’s descendants, Temah’s descendants,\nNeziah’s descendants, Hatipha’s descendants.\n\nThe descendants of Solomon’s servants  included\nSotai’s descendants, Sophereth’s descendants,\nPerida’s descendants, Jaala’s descendants,\nDarkon’s descendants, Giddel’s descendants,\nShephatiah’s descendants, Hattil’s descendants,\nPochereth-hazzebaim’s descendants, Amon’s descendants.\n\nAll the temple servants\nand the descendants of Solomon’s servants  392 .\n\nThe following  are those who came from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer, but were unable to prove that their ancestral families  and their lineage were Israelite:\nDelaiah’s descendants,\nTobiah’s descendants,\nand Nekoda’s descendants 642\nand from the priests: the descendants of Hobaiah, the descendants of Hakkoz, and the descendants of Barzillai #— #who had taken a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and who bore their name. These searched for their entries in the genealogical records, but they could not be found, so they were disqualified from the priesthood. The governor  ordered them not to eat the most holy things until there was a priest who could consult the Urim and Thummim. \nThe whole combined assembly numbered 42,360\nnot including their 7,337 male and female servants,\nas well as their 245 male and female singers.\nThey had 736 horses, 245 mules, \n435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys. \n\nSome of the family heads contributed to the project.

The rest of the people gave 20,000 gold coins, 2,000 silver minas, and 67 priestly garments. The priests, Levites, gatekeepers, temple singers, some of the people, temple servants, and all Israel settled in their towns. \n\nWhen the seventh month  came and the Israelites had settled in their towns,",

      "chapter_text": "all the people gathered together  at the square in front of the Water Gate.  They asked the scribe Ezra  to bring the book of the law of Moses  that the LORD had given Israel. On the first day of the seventh month,  the priest Ezra  brought the law  before the assembly of men, women, and all who could listen with understanding. While he was facing the square in front of the Water Gate,  he read out of it from daybreak until noon before the men, the women, and those who could understand. All the people listened attentively  to the book of the law.  The scribe Ezra stood on a high wooden platform  made for this purpose. Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah stood beside him on his right; to his left were Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hash-baddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam. Ezra opened the book in full view of all the people, since he was elevated above everyone. As he opened it, all the people stood up. Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God, and with their hands uplifted  all the people said, “Amen, Amen! ”  Then they knelt low and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground. \nJeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah,  who were Levites,  , explained the law  to the people as they stood in their places. They read out of the book of the law of God, translating and giving the meaning so that the people could understand what was read. Nehemiah the governor,  Ezra the priest and scribe,  and the Levites who were instructing the people said to all of them, “This day  is holy to the LORD your God. Do not mourn or weep.”  For all the people were weeping as they heard the words of the law. Then he said to them, “Go and eat what is rich, drink what is sweet, and send portions to those who have nothing prepared,  since today  is holy to our Lord. Do not grieve, because the joy of the LORD is your strength.”  , And the Levites quieted all the people, saying, “Be still,  since today  is holy. Don’t grieve.” Then all the people began to eat and drink, send portions, and have a great celebration,  because they had understood the words that were explained to them.\n\nOn the second day, the family heads of all the people, along with the priests and Levites,  assembled before the scribe Ezra  to study the words of the law. They found written in the law how the LORD had commanded through Moses that the Israelites should dwell in shelters during the festival of the seventh month.  So they proclaimed and spread this news throughout their towns and in Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the hill country and bring back branches of olive, wild olive, myrtle, palm, and other leafy trees to make shelters, just as it is written.”  The people went out, brought back branches, and made shelters for themselves on each of their rooftops  and courtyards, the court of the house of God, the square by the Water Gate,  and the square by the Ephraim Gate.  The whole community that had returned from exile  made shelters and lived in them. The Israelites had not celebrated like this from the days of Joshua son of Nun until that day.  And there was tremendous joy.  Ezra  read out of the book of the law of God  every day, from the first day to the last. The Israelites celebrated the festival for seven days, and on the eighth day there was a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance.",

Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani stood on the raised platform built for the Levites  and cried out loudly to the LORD their God. Then the Levites #— #Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah   #— #said, “Stand up. Blessed be the LORD your God from everlasting to everlasting.” \nBlessed be your glorious name, \nand may it be exalted above all blessing and praise.\nYou,  LORD, are the only God.  ,\nYou created the heavens,\nthe highest heavens with all their stars,\nthe earth and all that is on it,\nthe seas and all that is in them.\nYou give life to all of them, \nand all the stars of heaven worship you. \nYou, the LORD,\nare the God who chose Abram\nand brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans, \nand changed his name to Abraham. \nYou found his heart faithful in your sight, \nand made a covenant with him\nto give the land of the Canaanites,\nHethites, Amorites, Perizzites,\nJebusites, and Girgashites —\nto give it to his descendants. \nYou have fulfilled your promise,\nfor you are righteous.\n\nYou saw the oppression of our ancestors in Egypt \nand heard their cry at the Red Sea.\nYou performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh,\nall his officials, and all the people of his land, \nfor you knew how arrogantly they treated our ancestors.\nYou made a name for yourself\nthat endures to this day.\nYou divided the sea before them,\nand they crossed through it on dry ground. \nYou hurled their pursuers into the depths\nlike a stone into raging water. \nYou led them with a pillar of cloud by day,\nand with a pillar of fire by night,\nto illuminate the way they should go. \nYou came down on Mount Sinai, \nand spoke to them from heaven.\nYou gave them impartial ordinances, reliable instructions,\nand good statutes and commands.\nYou revealed your holy Sabbath to them,\nand gave them commands, statutes, and instruction\nthrough your servant Moses. \nYou provided bread from heaven  for their hunger;\nyou brought them water from the rock  for their thirst.\nYou told them to go in and possess the land\nyou had sworn  to give them. \n\nBut our ancestors acted arrogantly;\nthey became stiff-necked and did not listen to your commands.\nThey refused to listen\nand did not remember your wonders\nyou performed among them. \nThey became stiff-necked and appointed a leader\nto return to their slavery in Egypt.  ,\nBut you are a forgiving God,\ngracious and compassionate,\nslow to anger and abounding in faithful love, \nand you did not abandon them.\nEven after they had cast an image of a calf\nfor themselves and said,\n“This is your god who brought you out of Egypt,” \nand they had committed terrible blasphemies,\nyou did not abandon them in the wilderness\nbecause of your great compassion.\nDuring the day the pillar of cloud\nnever turned away from them,\nguiding them on their journey.\nAnd during the night the pillar of fire\nilluminated the way they should go. \nYou sent your good Spirit  to instruct them.\nYou did not withhold your manna  from their mouths,\nand you gave them water for their thirst. \nYou provided for them in the wilderness forty years, \nand they lacked nothing.\nTheir clothes did not wear out,\nand their feet did not swell. \n\nYou gave them kingdoms and peoples\nand established boundaries for them.\nThey took possession\nof the land of King Sihon  of Heshbon\nand of the land of King Og of Bashan. \nYou multiplied their descendants\nlike the stars of the sky \nand brought them to the land\nyou told their ancestors to go in and possess.\nSo their descendants went in and possessed the land:\nYou subdued the Canaanites who inhabited the land before them\nand handed their kings and the surrounding peoples over to them, \nto do as they pleased with them.\nThey captured fortified cities and fertile land\nand took possession of well-supplied houses,\ncisterns cut out of rock, vineyards,\nolive groves, and fruit trees in abundance. \nThey ate, were filled,\nbecame prosperous, and delighted in your great goodness.\n\nBut they were disobedient and rebelled against you.\nThey flung your law behind their backs \nand killed your prophets \nwho warned them\nin order to turn them back to you.\nThey committed terrible blasphemies.\nSo you handed them over to their enemies,\nwho oppressed them.\nIn their time of distress, they cried out to you,\nand you heard from heaven.\nIn your abundant compassion\nyou gave them deliverers, who rescued them\nfrom the power of their enemies.\nBut as soon as they had relief,\nthey again did what was evil in your sight.\nSo you abandoned them to the power of their enemies,\nwho dominated them.\nWhen they cried out to you again,\nyou heard from heaven and rescued them\nmany times in your compassion. \nYou warned them to turn back to your law,\nbut they acted arrogantly\nand would not obey your commands.\nThey sinned against your ordinances,\nwhich a person will live by if he does them. \nThey stubbornly resisted, \nstiffened their necks, and would not obey.\nYou were patient with them for many years,\nand your Spirit warned them through your prophets, \nbut they would not listen.\nTherefore, you handed them over to the surrounding peoples. \nHowever, in your abundant compassion,\nyou did not destroy them or abandon them, \nfor you are a gracious and compassionate God. \n\nSo now, our God #— #the great, mighty,\nand awe-inspiring God who keeps his gracious covenant   —\ndo not view lightly all the hardships that have afflicted us,\nour kings and leaders,\nour priests and prophets,\nour ancestors and all your people,\nfrom the days of the Assyrian kings  until today.\nYou are righteous concerning all that has happened to us,\nbecause you have acted faithfully,\nwhile we have acted wickedly. \nOur kings, leaders, priests, and ancestors\ndid not obey your law\nor listen to your commands\nand warnings you gave them.\nWhen they were in their kingdom,\nwith your abundant goodness that you gave them,\nand in the spacious and fertile land you set before them, \nthey would not serve you or turn from their wicked ways.\n\nHere we are today,\nslaves in the land you gave our ancestors\nso that they could enjoy its fruit and its goodness.\nHere we are #— #slaves in it! \nIts abundant harvest goes to the kings\nyou have set over us,\nbecause of our sins.\nThey rule over our bodies\nand our livestock as they please. \nWe are in great distress.\n\nIn view of all this, we are making a binding agreement  in writing on a sealed document containing the names of our leaders, Levites, and priests.",

      "chapter_text": "These  are the priests and Levites  who went up with Zerubbabel  son of Shealtiel and with Jeshua:\nSeraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,\nAmariah, Malluch, Hattush,\nShecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,\nIddo,  Ginnethoi, Abijah, \nMijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,\nShemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah, \nSallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah.\nThese were the heads of the priests and their relatives in the days of Jeshua. \nThe Levites:\nJeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel,\nSherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah   —\nhe and his relatives were in charge of the songs of praise.\nBakbukiah, Unni,  and their relatives stood opposite them in the services.\nJeshua fathered Joiakim,\nJoiakim fathered Eliashib,\nEliashib  fathered Joiada,\nJoiada fathered Jonathan,\nand Jonathan fathered Jaddua. \n\nIn the days of Joiakim, the heads of the priestly families were\nMeraiah of Seraiah,\nHananiah of Jeremiah,\nMeshullam of Ezra,\nJehohanan of Amariah,\nJonathan of Malluchi,\nJoseph of Shebaniah,\nAdna of Harim,\nHelkai of Meraioth,\nZechariah of Iddo,\nMeshullam of Ginnethon,\nZichri of Abijah,\nPiltai of Moadiah, of Miniamin,\nShammua of Bilgah,\nJehonathan of Shemaiah,\nMattenai of Joiarib,\nUzzi of Jedaiah,\nKallai of Sallai,\nEber of Amok,\nHashabiah of Hilkiah,\nand Nethanel of Jedaiah.\n\nIn the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, the heads of the families of the Levites and priests were recorded while Darius the Persian ruled. Levi’s descendants, the family heads, were recorded in the Book of the Historical Events  during the days of Johanan son of Eliashib. The heads of the Levites #— #Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua son of Kadmiel, along with their relatives opposite them #— #gave praise and thanks, division by division, as David the man of God had prescribed.  This included Mattaniah,  Bakbukiah, and Obadiah. Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms at the city gates.  These served in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor  and Ezra the priest and scribe. \n\nAt the dedication of the wall  of Jerusalem, they sent for the Levites wherever they lived and brought them to Jerusalem to celebrate the joyous dedication with thanksgiving and singing accompanied by cymbals, harps, and lyres.  The singers gathered from the region around Jerusalem, from the settlements of the Netophathites,  from Beth-gilgal, and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for they had built settlements for themselves around Jerusalem. After the priests and Levites had purified themselves, they purified the people, the city gates, and the wall. \nThen I brought the leaders of Judah up on top of the wall, and I appointed two large processions that gave thanks. One went to the right on the wall, toward the Dung Gate.  Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed, along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, and some of the priests’ sons with trumpets, and Zechariah son of Jonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Micaiah, son of Zaccur, son of Asaph followed as well as his relatives #— #Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David, the man of God.  Ezra the scribe  went in front of them. At the Fountain Gate  they climbed the steps of the city of David  on the ascent of the wall and went above the house of David to the Water Gate  on the east.\nThe second thanksgiving procession went to the left, and I followed it with half the people along the top of the wall, past the Tower of the Ovens  to the Broad Wall,  above the Ephraim Gate,  and by the Old Gate,  the Fish Gate,  the Tower of Hananel, and the Tower of the Hundred, to the Sheep Gate.  They stopped at the Gate of the Guard.  The two thanksgiving processions stood in the house of God. So did I and half of the officials accompanying me, as well as the priests:\nEliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin,\nMicaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah,\nand Hananiah, with trumpets;\nand Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar,\nUzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer.\nThen the singers sang, with Jezrahiah as the leader. On that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced because God had given them great joy.  The women and children also celebrated, and Jerusalem’s rejoicing was heard far away. \n\nOn that same day men were placed in charge of the rooms  that housed the supplies, contributions, firstfruits, and tenths.  The legally required portions for the priests and Levites  were gathered from the village fields, because Judah was grateful to the priests and Levites who were serving.  They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, along with the singers and gatekeepers,  as David and his son Solomon had prescribed.  For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph,  there were heads  of the singers and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.  So in the days of Zerubbabel  and Nehemiah,  all Israel contributed the daily portions  for the singers and gatekeepers. They also set aside daily portions for the Levites, and the Levites set aside daily portions  for Aaron’s descendants.",

      "chapter_text": "At that time  the book of Moses  was read publicly to  the people.  The command was found written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite  should ever enter the assembly of God,  because they did not meet the Israelites with food and water. Instead, they hired Balaam against them to curse them,  but our God turned the curse into a blessing.  When they heard the law, they separated all those of mixed descent  from Israel.\nNow before this, the priest Eliashib  had been put in charge of the storerooms of the house of our God.  He was a relative  of Tobiah  and had prepared a large room for him where they had previously stored the grain offerings, the frankincense, the articles, and the tenths of grain, new wine, and fresh oil  prescribed for the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers, along with the contributions for the priests. \nWhile all this was happening, I was not in Jerusalem, because I had returned to King Artaxerxes  of Babylon  in the thirty-second year of his reign.  It was only later that I asked the king for a leave of absence  so I could return to Jerusalem. Then I discovered the evil that Eliashib had done on behalf of Tobiah by providing him a room in the courts of God’s house. I was greatly displeased and threw all of Tobiah’s household possessions out of the room. I ordered that the rooms be purified,  and I had the articles of the house of God restored there, along with the grain offering and frankincense.  I also found out that because the portions for the Levites had not been given,  each of the Levites and the singers performing the service had gone back to his own field.  Therefore, I rebuked the officials, asking, “Why has the house of God been neglected? ”  I gathered the Levites and singers together and stationed them at their posts.  Then all Judah brought a tenth of the grain, new wine, and fresh oil into the storehouses.  I appointed as treasurers over the storehouses the priest Shelemiah, the scribe Zadok, and Pedaiah of the Levites, with Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah to assist them, because they were considered trustworthy.  They were responsible for the distribution to their colleagues. \nRemember me for this, my God, and don’t erase the deeds of faithful love I have done for the house of my God and for its services. \nAt that time I saw people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath. They were also bringing in stores of grain and loading them on donkeys, along with wine, grapes, and figs. All kinds of goods were being brought to Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I warned them against selling food on that day.  The Tyrians living there were importing fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them on the Sabbath to the people of Judah in Jerusalem. \nI rebuked the nobles of Judah and said to them, “What is this evil you are doing #— #profaning the Sabbath day?  Didn’t your ancestors do the same, so that our God brought all this disaster on us and on this city?  And now you are rekindling his anger against Israel by profaning the Sabbath! ”\nWhen shadows began to fall on the city gates of Jerusalem just before the Sabbath, I gave orders that the city gates be closed and not opened until after the Sabbath.  I posted some of my men at the gates, so that no goods could enter during the Sabbath day.  Once or twice the merchants and those who sell all kinds of goods camped outside Jerusalem, but I warned them, “Why are you camping in front of the wall? If you do it again, I’ll use force  against you.” After that they did not come again on the Sabbath. Then I instructed the Levites to purify themselves  and guard the city gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy. \nRemember me for this also, my God,  and look on me with compassion according to the abundance of your faithful love. \nIn those days I also saw Jews who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab.  Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of one of the other peoples but could not speak Hebrew.  , I rebuked them, cursed them, beat some of their men, and pulled out their hair.  I forced them to take an oath  before God and said, “You must not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters as wives for your sons or yourselves!  Didn’t King Solomon of Israel sin in matters like this? There was not a king like him among many nations. He was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel, yet foreign women drew him into sin.  Why then should we hear about you doing all this terrible evil and acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women? ”  Even one of the sons of Jehoiada, son of the high priest Eliashib,  had become a son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite.  So I drove him away from me. \nRemember them, my God, for defiling the priesthood as well as the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites. \nSo I purified them from everything foreign  and assigned specific duties to each of the priests and Levites.  I also arranged for the donation of wood at the appointed times and for the firstfruits. \nRemember me, my God, with favor.",
