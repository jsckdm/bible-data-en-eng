      "chapter_text": "The beginning  of the gospel  of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.  , As it is written in Isaiah  the prophet:  ,\nSee, I am sending my messenger   ahead of you;\nhe will prepare your way.   , ,\nA voice of one crying out in the wilderness:  \nPrepare the way for the Lord;  \nmake his paths straight!   ,\nJohn came baptizing  , in the wilderness  and proclaiming a baptism of repentance  for the forgiveness  of sins.  The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem  were going out to him, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan  River, confessing  their sins.  John wore a camel-hair garment with a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts  and wild honey. \nHe proclaimed, “One who is more powerful  than I am is coming after me.  I am not worthy  to stoop down and untie the strap of his sandals.  I baptize you with  water,  but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.” \n\nIn  those days Jesus came from Nazareth  in Galilee  and was baptized in the Jordan by John. As soon as he came up out of the water, he saw the heavens  being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. And a voice  came from heaven:  “You are my beloved  Son;  with you I am well-pleased.” \n\nImmediately  the Spirit  drove  him into the wilderness.  He was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted  by Satan.  He was with the wild animals,  and the angels  were serving him.\n\nAfter  John was arrested,  Jesus went to Galilee,  proclaiming  the good news  , , of God:  “The time   is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God   has come   near.   Repent   and believe   the good news! ”\n\nAs  he passed alongside the Sea of Galilee,  he saw Simon  and Andrew,  Simon’s brother, casting a net into the sea   #— #for they were fishermen. “Follow me,”   Jesus told them, “and I will make you fish for   , people.”   Immediately they left their nets and followed  him.  Going on a little farther, he saw James  the son of Zebedee  and his brother John  in a boat putting their nets in order. Immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him. \n\nThey  went into Capernaum,  and right away he entered the synagogue  on the Sabbath  and began to teach.  They were astonished  at his teaching  because he was teaching them as one who had authority, and not like the scribes.\nJust then a man with an unclean  spirit  was in their synagogue.  He cried out, “What do you have to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth?  Have you come to destroy  us? I know who you are #— #the Holy  One of God! ” \nJesus rebuked  him saying, “Be silent,   and come out of him! ” And the unclean spirit threw him into convulsions,  shouted with a loud voice, and came out of him.\nThey were all amazed,  and so they began to ask  each other, “What is this? A new teaching  with authority!  , He commands even the unclean  spirits,  and they obey him.” At once the news about him spread throughout the entire vicinity of Galilee. \n\nAs  soon as they left the synagogue,  they went into Simon  and Andrew’s  house  with James  and John.  Simon’s mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever, and they told him about her at once. So he went to her, took her by the hand, and raised her up.  The fever  left her,  and she began to serve  them. \nWhen  evening came, after the sun had set, they brought to him all those who were sick  and demon-possessed.  The whole town was assembled at the door, and he healed  many who were sick with various diseases  and drove out  many demons.  And he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him. \n\nVery  early in the morning, while it was still dark, he got up, went out, and made his way to a deserted place;  and there he was praying.  Simon  and his companions searched for him, and when they found him they said, “Everyone is looking for you.”\nAnd he said to them, “Let’s go on to the neighboring villages so that I may preach   there too. This is why I have come.”\n\nHe went into all of Galilee,  preaching in their synagogues  and driving out demons. Then  a man with leprosy  , came to him and, on his knees,  , begged him, “If you are willing, you can make me clean.”  Moved with compassion,  , Jesus reached out his hand and touched  him. “I am willing,” he told him. “Be made clean.” Immediately the leprosy  left him, and he was made clean. Then he sternly warned  him and sent him away  at once, telling him, “See that you say nothing to anyone;   but go and show   yourself to the priest,   and offer   what Moses commanded for your cleansing,   as a testimony   to them.”   Yet he went out and began to proclaim  it widely and to spread the news,  with the result that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly. But he was out in deserted places, and they came to him from everywhere.",

      "chapter_text": "When  he entered Capernaum  again after some days, it was reported that he was at home. So many people gathered together that there was no more room, not even in the doorway, and he was speaking the word  to them. They came to him bringing a paralytic,  carried by four of them. Since they were not able to bring him to  Jesus because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him, and after digging through it, they lowered the mat on which the paralytic was lying. Seeing their faith,  Jesus told the paralytic, “Son, your sins   are forgiven.”  \nBut some of the scribes  were sitting there, questioning  in their hearts: “Why does he speak like this? He’s blaspheming!  Who can forgive  sins  but God alone? ” \nRight away  Jesus perceived in his spirit  that they were thinking like this within themselves and said to them, “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts? Which is easier:   to say to the paralytic,   ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, take your mat, and walk’?   But so that you may know that the Son of Man   has authority   on earth to forgive sins”    #— #he told the paralytic — “I tell you: get up,   take your mat, and go home.”\nImmediately he got up, took the mat, and went out in front of everyone. As a result, they were all astounded  and gave glory  to God,  saying, “We have never seen anything like this! ” \n\nJesus  went out again beside the sea. The whole crowd was coming to him, and he was teaching  them. Then, passing by, he saw Levi  the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office,  and he said to him, “Follow me,”   and he got up and followed  him.\nWhile he was reclining at the table in Levi’s house, many tax collectors  and sinners  were eating  with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who were following him. When the scribes  who were Pharisees  , saw that he was eating  with sinners  and tax collectors,  they asked his disciples, “Why does he eat  with tax collectors and sinners? ”\nWhen Jesus heard this, he told them, “It is not those who are well who need   a doctor,   but those who are sick.   I didn’t come to call the righteous,   but sinners.”  \n\nNow  John’s  disciples  and the Pharisees  , were fasting.  People came and asked him, “Why do John’s disciples and the Pharisees’ disciples fast, but your disciples do not fast? ”\nJesus said to them, “The wedding guests cannot fast while the groom   is with them, can they? As long as they have the groom with them, they cannot fast. But the time   will come   when the groom will be taken away from them,   and then they will fast   on that day. No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new patch pulls away from the old cloth,   and a worse tear is made. And no one puts new wine   into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst   the skins, and the wine is lost as well as the skins. No, new wine is put into fresh wineskins.”\n\nOn  the Sabbath he was going through the grainfields, and his disciples  began to make their way, picking some heads of grain. The Pharisees  said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is not lawful  on the Sabbath? ”\nHe said to them, “Have you never read what David   and those who were with him did when he was in need   and hungry   #— # how he entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar   the high priest   and ate the bread of the Presence   #— #which is not lawful for anyone to eat except the priests   #— #and also gave some to his companions? ” Then he told them, “The Sabbath was made for   man and not man for the Sabbath.   So then, the Son of Man   is Lord   even of the Sabbath.”",

      "chapter_text": "Jesus  entered the synagogue  again, and a man was there who had a shriveled  hand. In order to accuse  him, they were watching him closely  to see whether he would heal  him on the Sabbath.  He told the man with the shriveled hand, “Stand before us.” Then he said to them, “Is it lawful   to do good   on the Sabbath or to do evil,   to save life   or to kill? ”   But they were silent.  After looking around at them with anger,  he was grieved at the hardness  of their hearts and told the man, “Stretch out your hand.” So he stretched it out, and his hand was restored.  Immediately the Pharisees  went out and started plotting  with the Herodians  against him, how they might kill  him.\n\nJesus  departed with his disciples to the sea, and a large crowd followed from Galilee,  and a large crowd followed from Judea,  Jerusalem,  Idumea, beyond the Jordan,  and around Tyre  and Sidon.  The large crowd came to him because they heard about everything he was doing. Then he told his disciples to have a small boat  ready for him, so that the crowd wouldn’t crush him. Since he had healed  many, all who had diseases were pressing toward him to touch  him. Whenever the unclean  spirits  saw him, they fell down  before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God! ”  And he would strongly warn  them not to make him known. \n\nJesus  went up the mountain  and summoned those he wanted, and they came to him. He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles,  , to be with him, to send them out to preach,  and to have authority to  drive out demons. He appointed the Twelve:  , To Simon,  he gave the name Peter;  and to James  the son of Zebedee,  and to his brother John,  he gave the name “Boanerges” (that is, “Sons of Thunder”  ); Andrew;  Philip  and Bartholomew; Matthew  and Thomas;  James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot,  who also betrayed him.\n\nJesus entered a house, and the crowd gathered again so that they were not even able to eat.  When his family  heard this, they set out to restrain him, because they said, “He’s out of his mind.” \nThe scribes  who had come down from Jerusalem said, “He is possessed by Beelzebul,”  and, “He drives out  demons  by the ruler  of the demons.” \nSo he summoned  them and spoke to them in parables:  “How can Satan   drive out Satan?   If a kingdom   is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand. And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand but is finished. But no one can enter a strong man’s house and plunder his possessions unless he first ties up   the strong man. Then he can plunder his house.\n“Truly I tell you, people will be forgiven for all sins and whatever blasphemies   they utter. But whoever blasphemes   against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness,   but is guilty   of an eternal sin”   ,  #— # because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.” \n\nHis  mother  and his brothers  came, and standing outside, they sent word to him and called him. A crowd was sitting around him and told him, “Look, your mother, your brothers,  and your sisters  are outside asking for you.”\nHe replied to them, “Who are my mother and my brothers? ” Looking at those sitting in a circle around him, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers!   Whoever does the will of God   is my brother and sister and mother.”",

So he got into a boat on the sea and sat down, while the whole crowd was by the sea on the shore. He taught them many things in parables,  and in his teaching  he said to them, “Listen! Consider the sower who went out to sow.   As he sowed, some seed fell along the path,   and the birds came and devoured   it. Other seed fell on rocky ground where it didn’t have much soil, and it grew up quickly,   since the soil wasn’t deep. When the sun came up, it was scorched, and since it had no root, it withered away.   Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns came up and choked it, and it didn’t produce fruit. Still other seed fell on good ground and it grew up, producing fruit that increased   thirty, sixty, and a hundred times.”   Then he said, “Let anyone who has ears to hear listen.”  \n\nWhen he was alone, those around him with the Twelve  asked him about the parables.  He answered them, “The secret   of the kingdom of God   has been given to you, but to those outside,   everything comes in parables so that\nthey may indeed look,\nand yet not perceive;\nthey may indeed listen,\nand yet not understand;  \notherwise, they might turn back\nand be forgiven. ”   , ,\n\nThen  he said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable?   How then will you understand all of the parables? The sower sows   the word.   Some are like the word sown on the path.   When they hear, immediately Satan   comes and takes away the word   sown in them.   And others are like seed sown on rocky ground. When they hear the word, immediately they receive it with joy.   But they have no root; they are short-lived. When distress   or persecution comes because of the word, they immediately fall away.   Others are like seed sown among thorns; these are the ones who hear the word, but the worries   of this age,   the deceitfulness   , of wealth,   and the desires   for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.   And those like seed sown on good ground hear the word,   welcome it, and produce fruit   thirty, sixty, and a hundred times what was sown.”\n\nHe  also said to them, “Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket or under a bed?   Isn’t it to be put on a lampstand?   For there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed,   and nothing concealed that will not be brought to light. If anyone has ears to hear, let him listen.”   And he said to them, “Pay attention to what you hear. By the measure   you use,   it will be measured to you #— #and more will be added   to you. For whoever has, more will be given to him, and whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.”  \n\n“The kingdom of God   is like this,” he said. “A man scatters seed on the ground. He sleeps   and rises   night   and day; the seed sprouts and grows, although he doesn’t know how. The soil produces a crop   by itself #— #first the blade, then the head, and then the full grain   on the head. As soon as the crop is ready, he sends for the sickle,   because the harvest   has come.”\n\nAnd  he said, “With what can we compare the kingdom of God,   or what parable   can we use to describe it? It’s like a mustard seed   that, when sown upon the soil, is the smallest of all the seeds on the ground. And when sown,   it comes up and grows taller than all the garden plants,   and produces large branches, so that the birds of the sky   can nest in its shade.”\n\nHe was speaking the word  to them with many parables  like these, as they were able to understand.  He did not speak to them without a parable. Privately, however, he explained everything to his own disciples. \n\nOn  that day, when evening had come, he told them, “Let’s cross over to the other side of the sea.” So they left the crowd and took him along since he was in the boat. And other boats were with him. A great windstorm  arose, and the waves  were breaking over the boat, so that the boat was already being swamped. He was in the stern, sleeping  on the cushion. So they woke him up  and said to him, “Teacher! Don’t you care that we’re going to die? ” \nHe got up, rebuked  the wind, and said to the sea, “Silence!   Be still! ” The wind ceased, and there was a great calm. Then he said to them, “Why are you afraid?   Do you still have no faith? ”\nAnd they were terrified  , and asked one another, “Who then is this? Even the wind and the sea obey  him! ”",

      "chapter_text": "They  came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gerasenes.  As soon as he got out of the boat, a man with an unclean  spirit  came out of the tombs  and met him. He lived in the tombs,  and no one was able to restrain him anymore #— #not even with a chain   #— # because he often had been bound with shackles and chains, but had torn the chains apart and smashed  the shackles. No one was strong enough to subdue  him. Night  and day among the tombs  and on the mountains,  he was always crying out and cutting himself with stones.\nWhen he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and knelt down before him. And he cried out with a loud voice, “What do you have to do with me, Jesus, Son  of the Most High God?  I beg you before God, don’t torment  me! ” For he had told him, “Come out of the man, you unclean   spirit! ”  \n“What is your name? ” he asked him.\n“My name is Legion,”  he answered him, “because we are many.” And he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the region.\nA large herd of pigs  was there, feeding  on the hillside. The demons  begged him, “Send us to the pigs, so that we may enter them.” So he gave them permission, and the unclean  spirits  came out and entered the pigs. The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned there.\nThe men who tended them ran off  and reported it in the town and the countryside, and people went to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and saw the man who had been demon-possessed,  , sitting there, dressed and in his right mind;  and they were afraid.  Those who had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed  man and told about the pigs. Then they began to beg him to leave their region.\nAs he was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged him earnestly that he might remain with him. Jesus did not let him but told him, “Go home to your own people, and report to them how much the Lord   has done   for you and how he has had mercy on you.” So he went out and began to proclaim  in the Decapolis  how much Jesus had done for him, and they were all amazed. \n\nWhen  Jesus had crossed over again by boat  to the other side, a large crowd  gathered around him while he was by the sea. One of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus,  came, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet  and begged him earnestly, “My little daughter is dying. Come and lay your hands on  her so that she can get well  , and live.” So Jesus went with him, and a large crowd was following and pressing against him.\nNow a woman suffering from bleeding  for twelve years had endured  much under many doctors.  She had spent everything she had and was not helped at all. On the contrary, she became worse. Having heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched  his clothing.  For she said, “If I just touch his clothes, I’ll be made well.”  Instantly her flow of blood ceased, and she sensed in her body that she was healed  of her affliction.\nImmediately Jesus realized that power  had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd  and said, “Who touched my clothes? ”  \nHis disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing against you, and yet you say, ‘Who touched me? ’  ”\nBut he was looking around to see who had done this. The woman, with fear and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down  before him, and told him the whole truth.  “Daughter,” he said to her, “your faith   has saved you.   Go in peace and be healed   from your affliction.”  \nWhile he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue leader’s house and said, “Your daughter is dead. Why bother the teacher  anymore? ”\nWhen Jesus overheard  what was said, he told the synagogue leader, “Don’t be afraid.   Only believe.” He did not let anyone accompany him except Peter,  James,  and John,  James’s brother. They came to the leader’s house, and he saw a commotion #— #people weeping and wailing loudly. He went in and said to them, “Why are you making a commotion and weeping?   The child   is not dead but asleep.”   They laughed at him, but he put them all outside. He took the child’s father,  mother, and those who were with him, and entered the place where the child was. Then he took the child  by the hand and said to her, “Talitha koum”  (which is translated, “Little girl, I say to you, get up”   ). Immediately the girl got up  and began to walk.  (She was twelve years old.) At this they were utterly astounded.  Then he gave them strict orders that no one should know about this  and told them to give her something to eat.",

      "chapter_text": "He  left there and came to his hometown,  and his disciples  followed him. When the Sabbath  came, he began to teach  in the synagogue,  and many who heard him were astonished. “Where did this man get these things? ” they said. “What is this wisdom  that has been given to him, and how are these miracles  performed by his hands? Isn’t this the carpenter,  the son of Mary,  and the brother of James,  Joses, Judas,  and Simon? And aren’t his sisters here with us? ” So they were offended  by him.\nJesus said to them, “A prophet   is not without honor   except in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his household.” He was not able to do a miracle  there, except that he laid his hands on  a few sick  people and healed  them. And he was amazed  at their unbelief.  He was going around the villages teaching. \n\nHe  summoned  the Twelve  and began to send  them out in pairs and gave them authority over unclean  spirits.  He instructed them to take nothing for the road except a staff #— #no bread, no traveling bag,  no money in their belts, but to wear sandals and not put on an extra shirt.  He said to them, “Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that place. If any place does not welcome   you or listen to you, when you leave there, shake the dust off your feet   as a testimony   against them.”   So they went out and preached  that people should repent.  They drove out many demons,  anointed  many sick  people with oil  and healed them. \n\nKing  Herod  heard about it, because Jesus’s name  had become well known. Some  said, “John the Baptist  has been raised from the dead,  and that’s why miraculous powers  are at work  in him.” But others said, “He’s Elijah.”  Still others said, “He’s a prophet, like one of the prophets from long ago.” \nWhen Herod  heard of it, he said, “John,  the one I beheaded, has been raised! ” \nFor  Herod himself had given orders to arrest John and to chain  him in prison on account of Herodias,  his brother Philip’s wife, because he had married her.  John had been telling Herod, “It is not lawful  for you to have your brother’s wife.”  So Herodias held a grudge against him and wanted to kill  him. But she could not, because Herod feared  John and protected him, knowing he was a righteous  and holy  man. When Herod heard him he would be very perplexed,  , and yet he liked to listen to him. \nAn opportune time came on his birthday, when Herod gave a banquet  for his nobles,  military commanders,  and the leading men of Galilee.  When Herodias’s own daughter  came in and danced,  she pleased Herod and his guests. The king said to the girl, “Ask me whatever you want, and I’ll give it to you.” He promised her with an  oath:  “Whatever you ask me I will give you, up to half my kingdom.” \nShe went out and said to her mother, “What should I ask for? ”\n“John the Baptist’s  head,” she said.\nAt once she hurried to the king and said, “I want you to give me John the Baptist’s  head on a platter  immediately.” Although the king was deeply distressed,  because of his oaths  and the guests  he did not want to refuse  her. The king immediately sent for an executioner and commanded him to bring John’s head. So he went and beheaded him in prison, brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl. Then the girl gave it to her mother. When John’s disciples  heard about it, they came and removed his corpse and placed it in a tomb. \n\nThe  apostles  gathered around Jesus and reported to him all that they had done and taught. He said to them, “Come away by yourselves to a remote place and rest for a while.” For many people were coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat.\nSo they went away in the boat by themselves to a remote place, but many saw them leaving and recognized them, and they ran on foot from all the towns and arrived ahead of them. \nWhen he went ashore, he saw a large crowd and had compassion  on them, because they were like sheep  without a shepherd. Then he began to teach them many things.\nWhen it grew late, his disciples  approached him and said, “This place is deserted,  and it is already late. Send them away so that they can go into the surrounding countryside and villages to buy themselves something to eat.”\n“You give them something to eat,” he responded.\nThey said to him, “Should we go and buy two hundred denarii  worth of bread and give them something to eat? ”\nHe asked them, “How many loaves do you have? Go and see.”\nWhen they found out they said, “Five, and two fish.” Then he instructed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass. So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties. He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves. He kept giving them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all. Everyone ate and was satisfied.  They picked up twelve baskets full of pieces of bread and fish. Now those who had eaten the loaves were five thousand men.\n\nImmediately  he made his disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, to Bethsaida,  while he dismissed the crowd. After he said good-bye to them, he went away to the mountain  to pray.  Well into the night, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he was alone on the land. He saw them straining  at the oars,  because the wind was against them. Very early in the morning  he came toward them walking on the sea and wanted to pass by them. When they saw him walking on the sea, they thought it was a ghost  and cried out, because they all saw him and were terrified.  Immediately he spoke with them and said, “Have courage!   It is I.   Don’t be afraid.”   Then he got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. They were completely astounded, because they had not understood about the loaves. Instead, their hearts were hardened. \n\nWhen they had crossed over, they came to shore at Gennesaret  and anchored there.\nAs they got out of the boat, people immediately recognized him. They hurried throughout that region and began to carry the sick  on mats to wherever they heard he was. Wherever he went, into villages, towns, or the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged him that they might touch just the end  of his robe.  And everyone who touched it was healed.",

      "chapter_text": "The  Pharisees  and some of the scribes  who had come from Jerusalem  gathered around him. They observed that some of his disciples were eating bread with unclean   #— #that is, unwashed #— #hands. (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, keeping the tradition of the elders. When they come from the marketplace,  they do not eat unless they have washed.  And there are many other customs they have received and keep, like the washing of cups, pitchers, kettles, and dining couches.  , ) So the Pharisees  and the scribes  asked him, “Why don’t your disciples live  according to the tradition of the elders,  instead of eating bread with ceremonially unclean  hands? ”\nHe answered them, “Isaiah   prophesied   correctly about you hypocrites,   as it is written:  \nThis people honors   me with their lips,\nbut their heart is far from me.\nThey worship me in vain,\nteaching   as doctrines   human commands.   ,\nAbandoning the command of God, you hold on to human tradition.”   He also said to them, “You have a fine way of invalidating God’s command in order to set up   your tradition! For Moses   said: Honor your father and your mother;   , and Whoever speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.   , But you say, ‘If anyone tells his father or mother: Whatever benefit   you might have received from me is corban’ ” (that is, an offering  devoted to God), “you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother. You nullify the word of God   by your tradition that you have handed   down. And you do many other similar things.”\nSummoning  the crowd again, he told them, “Listen to me, all of you, and understand:   Nothing that goes into a person from outside can defile him but the things that come out of a person are what defile him.”  \nWhen he went into the house away from the crowd, his disciples asked him about the parable. He said to them, “Are you also as lacking in understanding? Don’t you realize that nothing going into a person from the outside can defile him? For it doesn’t go into his heart but into the stomach   and is eliminated” (thus he declared all foods clean  ). And he said, “What comes out of a person is what defiles him. For from within, out of people’s hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immoralities,   thefts, murders,   adulteries,   greed,   evil actions, deceit,   self-indulgence,   envy,   slander,   pride,   and foolishness.   All these evil things come from within and defile a person.”\n\nHe got up and departed from  there to the region of Tyre.  , He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it, but he could not escape notice. Instead, immediately after hearing about him, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit  came and fell at his feet.  The woman was a Gentile,  , a Syrophoenician by birth, and she was asking him to cast the demon  out of her daughter. He said to her, “Let the children be fed first, because it isn’t right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”  \nBut she replied to him, “Lord,  even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”\nThen he told her, “Because of this reply, you may go. The demon has left your daughter.” When she went back to her home, she found her child lying on the bed, and the demon was gone.\n\nAgain, leaving the region of Tyre,  he went by way of Sidon to the Sea of Galilee,  through  the region of the Decapolis.  They brought to him a deaf  man who had difficulty speaking  and begged Jesus to lay his hand on  him. So he took him away from the crowd in private. After putting his fingers in the man’s ears and spitting,  he touched his tongue. Looking up to heaven,  he sighed deeply and said to him, “Ephphatha! ”  (that is, “Be opened! ”). Immediately his ears were opened,  his tongue was loosened, and he began to speak clearly.  He ordered them to tell no one,  but the more he ordered them, the more they proclaimed it. \nThey were extremely astonished and said, “He has done everything well.  He even makes the deaf  hear and the mute speak.”",

He called  the disciples  and said to them, “I have compassion   on the crowd, because they’ve already stayed with me three days and have nothing to eat. If I send them home hungry, they will collapse on the way,   and some of them have come a long distance.”\nHis disciples answered him, “Where can anyone get enough bread here in this desolate place to feed  these people? ”\n“How many loaves do you have? ” he asked them.\n“Seven,” they said. He commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground. Taking the seven loaves, he gave thanks, broke  them, and gave them to his disciples to set before the people. So they served them to the crowd. They also had a few small fish, and after he had blessed them, he said these were to be served as well. They ate and were satisfied. Then they collected seven large baskets of leftover pieces. About four thousand were there. He dismissed them. And he immediately got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha.\n\nThe  Pharisees  came and began to argue with him, demanding of him a sign  from heaven  to test  him. Sighing deeply in his spirit,  he said, “Why does this generation   demand a sign? Truly I tell you,   no sign will be given to this generation.” Then he left them, got back into the boat, and went to the other side.\nThe disciples had forgotten to take bread and had only one loaf with them in the boat. Then  he gave them strict orders: “Watch out! Beware of the leaven   , of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.”   They were discussing among themselves that they did not have any bread. Aware of this, he said to them, “Why are you discussing the fact you have no bread? Don’t you understand or comprehend? Do you have hardened hearts?   Do you have eyes and not see; do you have ears and not hear?   , And do you not remember?   When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of leftovers did you collect? ”\n“Twelve,” they told him.\n“When I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many baskets full of pieces did you collect? ”\n“Seven,” they said.\nAnd he said to them, “Don’t you understand yet? ”  \n\nThey came to Bethsaida.  They brought a blind  man to him and begged him to touch him. He took the blind man by the hand and brought him out of the village. Spitting  on his eyes and laying his hands on  him, he asked him, “Do you see anything? ”\nHe looked up and said, “I see people #— #they look like trees walking.” \nAgain Jesus placed his hands on the man’s eyes. The man looked intently and his sight was restored and he saw everything clearly. Then he sent  him home, saying, “Don’t even go into the village.”   ,\n\nJesus  went out with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the road he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that I am? ”\nThey answered him, “John the Baptist;  others, Elijah; still others, one of the prophets.” \n“But you,” he asked them, “who do you say that I am? ”\nPeter  answered him, “You are the Messiah.”  And he strictly warned  them to tell no one about him.\n\nThen  he began to teach them that it was necessary for the Son of Man  to suffer many things and be rejected  by the elders,  chief priests, and scribes,  be killed, and rise  after three days.  He spoke openly about this. Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. But turning around and looking at his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan!   You are not thinking about God’s concerns   but human concerns.”\n\nCalling the crowd along with his disciples, he said to them, “If anyone wants to follow after me, let him deny himself,   take up his cross,   and follow me.   For whoever wants to save   his life will lose it,   but whoever loses   his life   because of me   and the gospel   will save it.   For what does it benefit   someone to gain   the whole world   and yet lose   his life?   What can anyone give in exchange for his life?   For whoever is ashamed   of me and my words   in this adulterous and sinful   generation,   the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when he comes in the glory   of his Father   with the holy   angels.”",

He was transfigured  in front of them, and his clothes  became dazzling #— #extremely white  as no launderer on earth could whiten  them. Elijah  appeared to them with Moses,  and they were talking with Jesus. Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi,  it’s good  for us to be here. Let’s set up three shelters:  one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah” #— # because he did not know what to say,  since they were terrified. \nA cloud  appeared, overshadowing  them, and a voice  came from the cloud:  “This is my beloved  Son;  listen to him! ” \nSuddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus.\nAs  they were coming down the mountain,  he ordered them to tell no one what they had seen  until the Son of Man  had risen  from the dead.  They kept this word  to themselves, questioning what “rising from the dead” meant.\nThen they asked him, “Why do the scribes  say that Elijah must come first? ” \n“Elijah does come first and restores   all things,”   he replied. “Why then is it written   that the Son of Man must suffer   many things and be treated with contempt?   But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did whatever they pleased to him, just as it is written   about him.”\n\nWhen  they came to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and scribes disputing  with them. When the whole crowd saw him, they were amazed and ran to greet him. He asked them, “What are you arguing with them about? ”\nSomeone from the crowd answered him, “Teacher,  I brought my son to you. He has a spirit  that makes him unable to speak.  Whenever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive it out, but they couldn’t.”\nHe replied to them, “You unbelieving   generation, how long will I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him to me.” So they brought the boy to him. When the spirit saw him, it immediately threw the boy into convulsions. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth. “How long has this been happening to him? ” Jesus asked his father.\n“From childhood,” he said. “And many times it has thrown him into fire or water to destroy  him. But if you can do anything, have compassion  on us and help us.”\nJesus said to him, “ ‘If you can’?   Everything is possible   for the one who believes.”  \nImmediately the father of the boy cried out, “I do believe; help my unbelief! ”\nWhen Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly gathering, he rebuked  the unclean  spirit, saying to it, “You mute and deaf   spirit, I command you: Come out of him and never enter him again.”\nThen it came out, shrieking and throwing him into terrible convulsions.  The boy became like a corpse, so that many said, “He’s dead.” But Jesus, taking him by the hand, raised him,  and he stood up.\nAfter he had gone into the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we drive it out? ”\nAnd he told them, “This kind can come out by nothing but prayer.”   ,\n\nThen  they left that place and made their way through Galilee, but he did not want anyone to know it.  For he was teaching  his disciples and telling them, “The Son of Man   is going to be betrayed   into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after he is killed, he will rise   three days later.”   But they did not understand this statement, and they were afraid to ask him. \n\nThey  came to Capernaum.  When he was in the house,  he asked them, “What were you arguing about on the way? ”   But they were silent,  because on the way they had been arguing with one another about who was the greatest.  Sitting down, he called the Twelve  and said to them, “If anyone wants to be first, he must be last and servant of all.”   He took a child,  had him stand among them, and taking him in his arms, he said to them, “Whoever welcomes   one little child such as this in my name   welcomes me. And whoever welcomes me does not welcome me, but him who sent   me.”  \n\nJohn  said to him, “Teacher,  we saw someone  driving out demons  in your name,  and we tried to stop him because he wasn’t following us.” \n“Don’t stop him,” said Jesus, “because there is no one who will perform a miracle   in my name who can soon afterward speak evil of me. For whoever is not against us is for us.   And whoever gives you a cup of water to drink   in my name, because you belong to Christ   #— #truly I tell you,   he will never lose his reward.  \n\n“But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to fall away   #— #it would be better for him if a heavy millstone   were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.\n“And if your hand causes you to fall away, cut it off.   It is better for you to enter life maimed   than to have two hands and go to hell, the unquenchable fire.   , And if your foot causes you to fall away, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame   than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.   And if your eye causes you to fall away, gouge it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God   with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown   into hell,   where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.   For everyone will be salted with fire.   , , Salt is good, but if the salt should lose its flavor, how can you season it?   Have salt   among yourselves, and be at peace   with one another.”",

      "chapter_text": "He  set out from there and went to the region of Judea  and across the Jordan.  Then crowds converged on him again, and as was his custom he taught  them again.\nSome Pharisees  came to test  him, asking, “Is it lawful  for a man to divorce  his wife? ” \nHe replied to them, “What did Moses   command you? ”\nThey said, “Moses permitted us to write divorce papers  and send her away.” \nBut Jesus told them, “He wrote this command for you because of the hardness of your hearts.   But from the beginning   of creation   God   made them male and female.   , For this reason a man will leave   his father and mother   and the two will become one flesh.   , So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”  \nWhen they were in the house again, the disciples questioned him about this matter. He said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife   and marries   another commits adultery   against her. Also, if she divorces her husband   and marries another, she commits adultery.”\n\nPeople  were bringing little children  to him in order that he might touch them, but the disciples rebuked  them. When Jesus saw it, he was indignant  and said to them, “Let the little children come to me.   Don’t stop   them, because the kingdom of God   belongs to such as these. Truly I tell you,   whoever does not receive   , the kingdom of God like a little child   will never enter it.” After taking them in his arms, he laid his hands on  them and blessed  them.\n\nAs  he was setting out on a journey,  a man ran up, knelt down  before him, and asked him, “Good  teacher,  what must I do to inherit  eternal life? ” \n“Why do you call me good? ” Jesus asked him. “No one is good except God alone.   You know the commandments: Do not murder;   do not commit adultery;   do not steal;   do not bear false witness;   do not defraud;   honor   your father and mother. ”   ,\nHe said to him, “Teacher,  I have kept all these from my youth.”\nLooking at him, Jesus loved him  and said to him, “You lack one thing: Go, sell all you have and give to the poor,   and you will have treasure   in heaven.   Then come,   follow me.”   But he was dismayed by this demand, and he went away grieving,  because he had many possessions. \n\nJesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How hard it is for those who have wealth   to enter the kingdom of God! ”  \nThe disciples were astonished at his words. Again Jesus said to them, “Children,   how hard it is   to enter the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich   person to enter the kingdom of God.”\nThey were even more astonished, saying to one another, “Then who can be saved? ” \nLooking at them, Jesus said, “With man it is impossible,   but not with God, because all things are possible with God.”\nPeter  began to tell him, “Look, we have left everything and followed you.”\n“Truly I tell you,”   Jesus said, “there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father   or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the gospel,   who will not receive a hundred times   more, now at this time   #— #houses, brothers and sisters, mothers and children, and fields, with persecutions   #— #and eternal life   in the age to come.   But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”  \n\nThey  were on the road, going up to Jerusalem,  and Jesus was walking ahead of them. The disciples were astonished, but those who followed him were afraid.  Taking the Twelve aside again, he began to tell them the things that would happen to him.  “See, we are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man   will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes,   and they will condemn him to death. Then they will hand him over to the Gentiles,   and they will mock him, spit on him, flog   him, and kill him, and he will rise   after three days.”  \n\nJames  and John,  the sons of Zebedee,  approached him and said, “Teacher,  we want you to do whatever we ask you.”\n“What do you want me to do for you? ” he asked them.\nThey answered him, “Allow us to sit at your right and at your left in your glory.” \nJesus said to them, “You don’t know what you’re asking.   Are you able to drink the cup   I drink or to be baptized with the baptism   I am baptized with? ”  \n“We are able,” they told him.\nJesus said to them, “You will drink the cup I drink, and you will be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with.   But to sit at my right or left is not mine to give; instead, it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”\nWhen the ten disciples heard this, they began to be indignant with James and John.  Jesus called them over and said to them, “You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over   them, and those in high positions act as tyrants over them. But it is not so among you.   On the contrary, whoever wants to become great among you will be your servant,   and whoever wants to be first among you will be a slave to all.   For even the Son of Man   did not come to be served, but to serve,   and to give his life   as a ransom   for many.”   ,\n\nThey  came to Jericho.  And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a large crowd, Bartimaeus (the son of Timaeus), a blind  beggar,  was sitting by the road.  When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth,  he began to cry out, “Jesus, Son of David,  have mercy  on me! ”  Many warned him to keep quiet, but he was crying out all the more, “Have mercy on me,  Son of David! ”\nJesus stopped and said, “Call him.”\nSo they called the blind man and said to him, “Have courage!  Get up; he’s calling for you.” He threw off his coat,  jumped up, and came to Jesus.\nThen Jesus answered him, “What do you want   me to do for you? ”\n“Rabboni,”   , the blind man said to him, “I want to see.”\nJesus said to him, “Go, your faith has saved you.”   Immediately he could see and began to follow Jesus on the road.",

      "chapter_text": "When  they approached Jerusalem,  at Bethphage and Bethany  near the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples and told them, “Go into the village ahead of you. As soon as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it. If anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this? ’ say, ‘The Lord needs it and will send it back here right away.’ ”\nSo they went and found a colt outside in the street, tied by a door. They untied it, and some of those standing there said to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt? ” They answered them just as Jesus had said; so they let them go.\nThey brought the colt to Jesus and threw their clothes on it, and he sat on it. Many people spread their clothes on the road,  and others spread leafy branches cut from the fields.  Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted:\nHosanna!\nBlessed is he who comes\nin the name   of the Lord!   ,\nBlessed is the coming kingdom \nof our father David! \nHosanna   in the highest heaven!\nHe went into Jerusalem  and into the temple.  After looking around at everything, since it was already late, he went out to Bethany  with the Twelve.\n\nThe  next day when they went out from Bethany, he was hungry. Seeing in the distance a fig  tree with leaves, he went to find out if there was anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it was not the season for figs. He said to it, “May no one ever eat fruit   from you again! ”   And his disciples  heard it.\n\nThey came to Jerusalem,  and he went into the temple  and began to throw out those buying and selling. He overturned the tables of the money changers  and the chairs of those selling doves, and would not permit anyone to carry goods through the temple. He was teaching them: “Is it not written,   My house   will be called a house of prayer   for all nations ?   But you have made it a den of thieves ! ”   ,\nThe chief priests and the scribes  heard it and started looking for a way to kill him. For they were afraid  of him, because the whole crowd was astonished by his teaching.\nWhenever evening came, they would go out of the city.\n\nEarly  in the morning, as they were passing by, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots up. Then Peter  remembered and said to him, “Rabbi,  look! The fig tree that you cursed  has withered.”\nJesus replied to them, “Have faith in God.   Truly I tell you,   if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt   in his heart, but believes   that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.   Therefore I tell you, everything you pray   and ask for   #— #believe that you have received   , it and it will be yours. And whenever you stand   praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive   him, so that your Father   in heaven   will also forgive   you your wrongdoing.”  \n\nThey  came again to Jerusalem.  As he was walking in the temple,  the chief priests, the scribes,  and the elders  came and asked him, “By what authority  are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority to do these things? ”\nJesus said to them, “I will ask you one question;   then answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. Was John’s baptism   from heaven or of human origin? Answer me.”\nThey discussed it among themselves: “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Then why didn’t you believe  him? ’ But if we say, ‘Of human origin’ ” #— #they were afraid of the crowd, because everyone thought that John was truly a prophet.  So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.”\nAnd Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”",

Then he leased it to tenant farmers and went away. At harvest time he sent   a servant   to the farmers to collect some of the fruit   of the vineyard from them. But they took him, beat   him, and sent him away empty-handed.   Again he sent another servant to them, and they   hit him on the head and treated him shamefully.   Then he sent another, and they killed that one. He also sent many others; some they beat, and others they killed. He still had one to send, a beloved   son. Finally   he sent him to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ But those tenant farmers said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ So they seized him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard. What then will the owner   , of the vineyard do? He will come and kill the farmers and give the vineyard to others. Haven’t you read this Scripture:  \nThe   stone that the builders rejected\nhas become the cornerstone.  \nThis came about from the Lord  \nand is wonderful in our eyes ? ”  \n\nThey were looking for a way to arrest him but feared the crowd because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. So they left him and went away.\n\nThen  they sent some of the Pharisees  and the Herodians  to Jesus to trap him in his words.  When they came, they said to him, “Teacher, we know you are truthful and don’t care what anyone thinks, nor do you show partiality  but teach the way of God truthfully. Is it lawful to pay taxes  to Caesar or not? Should we pay or shouldn’t we? ”\nBut knowing their hypocrisy,  he said to them, “Why are you testing   me? Bring me a denarius   , to look at.” They brought a coin. “Whose image   and inscription   is this? ” he asked them.\n“Caesar’s,” they replied.\nJesus told them, “Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”   And they were utterly amazed  at him.\n\nSadducees,  who say there is no resurrection,  came to him and questioned him: “Teacher,  Moses  wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies , leaving a wife behind but no child,   that man should take the wife   and raise up offspring for his brother.   , There were seven brothers. The first married a woman, and dying, left no offspring. The second also took her, and he died, leaving no offspring. And the third likewise. None of the seven  left offspring. Last of all, the woman died too. In the resurrection, when they rise,  whose wife will she be, since the seven had married her? ”\nJesus spoke to them, “Isn’t this the reason why you’re mistaken: you don’t know the Scriptures   or the power   of God?   For when they rise   from the dead,   they neither marry nor are given in marriage   but are like angels   in heaven. And as for the dead being raised #— #haven’t you read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the burning bush, how God said to him: I   am the God of Abraham   and the God of Isaac   and the God of Jacob ?     He is not the God of the dead but of the living. You are badly mistaken.”\n\nOne  of the scribes  approached. When he heard them debating and saw that Jesus answered them well, he asked him, “Which command is the most important of all? ”\nJesus answered, “The most important   is Listen, Israel! The Lord   our God, the Lord   is one.   Love   the Lord your God   with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind,   and with all your strength.   , , The second is, Love your neighbor   as yourself.   , There is no other command   greater than these.”\nThen the scribe said to him, “You are right, teacher. You have correctly said that he is one, and there is no one  else except him.  And to love  him with all your heart, with all your understanding,  and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself, is far more important than all the burnt offerings and sacrifices.” \nWhen Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.”   And no one dared  to question him any longer.\n\nWhile  Jesus was teaching in the temple, he asked,  “How can the scribes   say that the Messiah   is the son of David?   David   himself says by the Holy Spirit:  \nThe Lord   declared to my Lord,\n‘Sit at my right hand  \nuntil I put your enemies under your feet.’   ,\nDavid himself calls him ‘Lord.’ How, then, can he be his son? ” And the large crowd was listening to him with delight.\n\nHe  also said in his teaching, “Beware of the scribes, who want to go around in long robes   and who want greetings in the marketplaces,   the best seats   in the synagogues,   and the places of honor   at banquets.   They devour   widows’   houses and say long prayers   just for show. These will receive harsher judgment.”\n\nSitting  across from the temple treasury,  he watched how the crowd dropped money into the treasury. Many rich  people were putting in large sums. Then a poor  widow came and dropped in two tiny coins worth very little. Summoning his disciples,  he said to them, “Truly I tell you,   this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others.   For they all gave out of their surplus,   but she out of her poverty   has put in everything she had   #— #all she had to live on.”",

      "chapter_text": "As  he was going out of the temple,  one of his disciples said to him, “Teacher,  look! What massive stones! What impressive buildings! ” \nJesus said to him, “Do you see these great buildings?   Not one stone will be left upon another #— #all will be thrown down.”\n\nWhile he was sitting on the Mount of Olives  across from the temple,  Peter,  James,  John,  and Andrew  asked him privately, “Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished? ”\nJesus told them, “Watch out that no one deceives you. Many will come in my name,   saying, ‘I am he,’   and they will deceive   many. When you hear of wars and rumors of wars,   don’t be alarmed;   these things must take place,   but it is not yet the end. For nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.   There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines.   These are the beginning   of birth pains.  \n\n“But you, be on your guard! They will hand you over to local courts,   , and you will be flogged   in the synagogues.   You will stand before governors and kings   because of me,   as a witness   to them.   And it is necessary that the gospel   be preached to all nations. So when they arrest you and hand you over, don’t worry beforehand what you will say, but say whatever is given to you at that time, for it isn’t you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.\n“Brother will betray   brother to death,   and a father his child. Children will rise up against parents and have them put to death. You will be hated by everyone because of my name,   but the one who endures to the end will be saved.  \n\n“When you see the abomination of desolation   , standing where it should not be” (let the reader understand), “then those in Judea   must flee to the mountains. A man on the housetop must not come down or go in to get anything out of his house,   and a man in the field must not go back to get his coat.   Woe   to pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days!\n“Pray   it   won’t happen in winter. For those will be days of tribulation,   the kind that hasn’t been from the beginning of creation   , which God created, until now and never will be again.   If the Lord   had not cut those days short,   no one would be saved. But he cut those days short for the sake of the elect,   whom he chose.  \n“Then if anyone tells you, ‘See, here is the Messiah!   See, there! ’ do not believe it. For false messiahs and false prophets will arise and will perform signs and wonders   to lead astray, if possible, the elect. And you must watch! I have told you everything in advance.\n\n“But in those days, after that tribulation:   The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not shed its light; the stars   will be falling from the sky, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.   Then they will see the Son of Man   coming   in clouds   with great power   and glory.   He will send out the angels   and gather his elect   from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.  \n\n“Learn   this lesson   from the fig   tree: As soon as its branch becomes tender and sprouts leaves, you know that summer is near.   In the same way, when you see these things happening, recognize   that he   is near #— #at the door.\n“Truly I tell you,   this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things take place. Heaven and earth   will pass away,   but my words will never pass away.  \n\n“Now concerning that day   or hour no one knows #— #neither the angels   in heaven nor the Son   #— #but only the Father.  \n“Watch! Be alert!   For you don’t know when the time   is coming.  \n“It is like   a man on a journey, who left his house, gave authority to his servants,   gave each one his work, and commanded the doorkeeper to be alert. Therefore be alert,   since you don’t know when the master   of the house is coming #— #whether in the evening or at midnight or at the crowing of the rooster or early in the morning. Otherwise, when he comes suddenly he might find you sleeping.   And what I say to you, I say to everyone: Be alert! ”",

      "chapter_text": "It  was two days before the Passover  and the Festival  of Unleavened Bread.  The chief priests and the scribes  were looking for a cunning  way to arrest Jesus and kill him.  “Not during the festival,” they said, “so that there won’t be a riot among the people.”\n\nWhile  he was in Bethany  at the house of Simon the leper,  , as he was reclining at the table,  a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured it on his head.  But some were expressing indignation to one another: “Why has this perfume been wasted? For this perfume might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii  , and given to the poor.”  And they began to scold her.\nJesus replied, “Leave her alone. Why are you bothering her? She has done a noble thing   for me. You always have the poor   with you, and you can do what is good for them whenever you want, but you do not always have me.   She has done what she could; she has anointed my body   in advance for burial.   Truly I tell you,   wherever the gospel   is proclaimed in the whole world,   what she has done will also be told in memory of her.”\nThen  Judas Iscariot,  one of the Twelve,  went to the chief priests  to betray Jesus  to them. And when they heard this, they were glad and promised to give him money.  So he started looking for a good opportunity to betray  him.\n\nOn  the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrifice the Passover lamb,  his disciples  asked him, “Where do you want us to go and prepare the Passover so that you may eat it? ”\nSo he sent two of his disciples and told them, “Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him. Wherever he enters, tell the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher   says, “Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples? ” ’ He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready. Make the preparations for us there.” So the disciples  went out, entered the city, and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.\n\nWhen  evening came, he arrived with the Twelve.  While they were reclining and eating, Jesus said, “Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me #— #one who is eating with me.”\nThey began to be distressed and to say to him one by one, “Surely not I? ”\nHe said to them, “It is one of the Twelve #— #the one who is dipping bread in the bowl with me. For the Son of Man   will go just as it is written   about him,   but woe   to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for him if he had not been born.”\n\nAs  they were eating, he took bread,  blessed and broke  it, gave it to them,  and said, “Take it; this is my body.”   Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks,  he gave it to them, and they all drank from it. He said to them, “This is my blood of the covenant,   , which is poured out   for many.   Truly I tell you,   I will no longer drink of the fruit of the vine   until that day when I drink it new   , in the kingdom of God.”  \nAfter singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. \n\nThen  Jesus said to them, “All of you will fall away,   because it is written:  \nI will strike the shepherd,\nand the sheep   will be scattered.   ,\nBut after I have risen,   I will go ahead of you to Galilee.”  \nPeter  told him, “Even if everyone falls away, I will not.”\n“Truly I tell you,” Jesus said to him, “today, this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.”  \nBut he kept insisting, “If I have to die with you, I will never deny you.” And they all said the same thing.\n\nThen  they came to a place named Gethsemane, and he told his disciples,  “Sit here while I pray.”   He took Peter,  James,  and John  with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled. He said to them, “I am deeply grieved   to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake.”   He went a little farther, fell to the ground, and prayed that if it were possible, the hour  might pass from him. And he said, “Abba,   Father!   All things are possible   for you. Take this cup   away from me. Nevertheless, not what I will, but what you will.” Then he came and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, “Simon,   are you sleeping?   Couldn’t you stay awake one hour? Stay awake and pray   so that you won’t enter into temptation.   , The spirit   is willing, but the flesh   is weak.” Once again he went away and prayed, saying the same thing. And again he came and found them sleeping, because they could not keep their eyes open. They did not know what to say to him.  Then he came a third time and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The time has come. See, the Son of Man   is betrayed into the hands of sinners.   Get up;   let’s go. See, my betrayer is near.”\n\nWhile  he was still speaking, Judas,  one of the Twelve,  suddenly arrived. With him was a mob, with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes,  and the elders.  His betrayer had given them a signal. “The one I kiss,” he said, “he’s the one; arrest him and take him away under guard.” So when he came, immediately he went up to Jesus and said, “Rabbi! ”  and kissed him. They took hold of him and arrested him. One of those who stood by drew his sword, struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his ear.\nJesus said to them, “Have you come out with swords and clubs, as if I were a criminal,   to capture me? Every day I was among you, teaching in the temple,   and you didn’t arrest me. But the Scriptures   must be fulfilled.”  \nThen they all deserted him and ran away.  Now a certain young man, wearing nothing but a linen cloth, was following him. They caught hold of him, but he left the linen cloth behind and ran away naked. \n\nThey  led Jesus away to the high priest,  and all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes  assembled.  Peter  followed him at a distance, right into the high priest’s courtyard. He was sitting with the servants,  , warming himself by the fire.\nThe chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin  were looking for testimony against Jesus to put him to death,  but they could not find any. For many were giving false testimony  against him, and the testimonies did not agree. Some stood up and gave false testimony against him, stating, “We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple made with human hands,  and in three days I will build another not made by hands.’ ” Yet their testimony did not agree  even on this.\nThen the high priest stood up before them all and questioned Jesus, “Don’t you have an answer to what these men are testifying against you? ” But he kept silent and did not answer.  Again the high priest questioned him, “Are you the Messiah,  the Son  of the Blessed  One? ”\n“I am,”   said Jesus, “and you will see the Son of Man   seated at the right hand   of Power and coming with the clouds   of heaven .”   ,\nThen the high priest  tore his robes  and said, “Why do we still need witnesses?  You have heard the blasphemy.  What is your decision? ” They all condemned him as deserving death. \nThen some began to spit on him, to blindfold him, and to beat him, saying, “Prophesy! ”  The temple servants  also took him and slapped him.\n\nWhile  Peter  was in the courtyard below, one of the high priest’s maidservants came. When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, “You also were with Jesus, the man from Nazareth.” \nBut he denied it: “I don’t know or understand what you’re talking about.” Then he went out to the entryway,  and a rooster crowed. \nWhen the maidservant saw him again, she began to tell those standing nearby, “This man is one of them.”\nBut again he denied it. After a little while those standing there said to Peter again, “You certainly are one of them, since you’re also a Galilean.”  ,\nThen he started to curse and swear,  “I don’t know this man you’re talking about! ”\nImmediately a rooster crowed a second time,  and Peter remembered when Jesus had spoken the word to him, “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” And he broke down and wept.",

Pilate  questioned him again, “Aren’t you going to answer? Look how many things they are accusing you of! ” But Jesus still did not answer, and so Pilate was amazed.\n\nAt  the festival  Pilate  used to release for the people a prisoner whom they requested. There was one named Barabbas, who was in prison with rebels who had committed murder  during the rebellion.  The crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do for them as was his custom. Pilate answered them, “Do you want me to release the king  of the Jews  for you? ” For he knew it was because of envy  that the chief priests had handed him over. But the chief priests stirred up the crowd so that he would release Barabbas to them instead. Pilate asked them again, “Then what do you want me to do with the one you call the king of the Jews? ”\nAgain they shouted, “Crucify him! ”\nPilate said to them, “Why? What has he done wrong? ”\nBut they shouted all the more, “Crucify him! ”\nWanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them; and after having Jesus flogged, he handed him over to be crucified.\n\nThe  soldiers led him away into the palace (that is, the governor’s residence  ) and called the whole company together. They dressed him in a purple  robe, twisted together a crown  of thorns, and put it on him. And they began to salute him, “Hail,  king  of the Jews! ” They were hitting him on the head with a stick and spitting on him. Getting down on their knees,  they were paying him homage. After they had mocked  him, they stripped him of the purple robe and put his clothes on him.\n\nThey led him out to crucify him. They  forced a man coming in from the country, who was passing by, to carry Jesus’s cross.  He was Simon of Cyrene,  the father of Alexander and Rufus. \nThey  brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means Place of the Skull  ). They tried to give him wine  mixed with myrrh,  but he did not take it.\nThen they crucified him and divided his clothes, casting lots  for them to decide what each would get. Now it was nine in the morning  when they crucified him. The inscription of the charge written against him was: THE K ING   OF THE JEWS.  They  crucified two criminals  , with him, one on his right and one on his left. \nThose  who passed by were yelling insults  at  him, shaking their heads,  and saying, “Ha! The one who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,  save yourself by coming down from the cross! ”  In the same way, the chief priests with the scribes  were mocking him among themselves and saying, “He saved others, but he cannot save himself! Let the Messiah,  the King  of Israel,  come down now from the cross,  so that we may see and believe.”  Even those who were crucified with him taunted him.\n\nWhen  it was noon,  darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.  , And at three Jesus cried out with a loud voice, “ Eloi, Eloi, lemá sabachtháni? ” which is translated, “ My God, my God, why have you abandoned me? ”   ,\nWhen some of those standing there heard this, they said, “See, he’s calling for Elijah.”\nSomeone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, fixed it on a stick, offered him a drink,  and said, “Let’s see if Elijah comes to take him down.”\nJesus let out a loud cry and breathed his last. Then the curtain  of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. When the centurion, who was standing opposite him, saw the way he  breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God! ”  ,\nThere  were also women watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene,  Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome. In Galilee  these women followed him and took care of him. Many other women had come up with him to Jerusalem. \n\nWhen  it was already evening, because it was the day of preparation (that is, the day before the Sabbath), Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Sanhedrin who was himself looking forward  to the kingdom of God,  came and boldly went to Pilate  and asked for Jesus’s body.  Pilate was surprised that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had already died. When he found out from the centurion, he gave the corpse to Joseph. After he bought some linen cloth, Joseph took him down and wrapped him in the linen. Then he laid him in a tomb  cut out of the rock and rolled a stone  against the entrance to the tomb. Mary Magdalene  and Mary the mother of Joses were watching where he was laid.",

Very early in the morning, on the first day of the week,  they went to the tomb  at sunrise. They were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone from the entrance to the tomb for us? ” Looking up, they noticed that the stone #— #which was very large #— #had been rolled away.\nWhen  they entered the tomb,  they saw a young man  dressed  in a white  robe sitting on the right side; they were alarmed. “Don’t be alarmed,” he told them. “You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth,  who was crucified. He has risen!  He is not here. See the place where they put him. But go, tell his disciples and Peter,  ‘He is going ahead of you to Galilee;  you will see him there just as he told you.’ ”\nThey went out and ran from the tomb,  because trembling and astonishment overwhelmed them. And they said nothing to anyone,  since they were afraid.\n\n¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥¥\n[Some of the earliest mss conclude with 16:8.] \n\n[Early  on the first day of the week,  after he had risen,  he appeared first to Mary Magdalene,  out of whom he had driven seven demons.  She went and reported to those who had been with him, as they were mourning and weeping. Yet, when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe it. \nAfter this, he appeared  in a different form to two of them walking on their way into the country.  And they went and reported it to the rest, who did not believe them either.\n\nLater he appeared to the Eleven  themselves as they were reclining at the table. He rebuked their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who saw him after he had risen.  Then  he said to them, “Go into all the world   and preach the gospel to all creation.   Whoever believes   and is baptized will be saved,   but whoever does not believe will be condemned.   And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues;   they will pick up snakes;   , if they should drink anything deadly, it will not harm   them; they will lay hands on   the sick, and they will get well.”\n\nSo the Lord Jesus, after speaking to them,  was taken up into heaven  and sat down at the right hand  of God. And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the accompanying signs.]",
