      "chapter_text": "The revelation of  Jesus Christ that God gave him to show his servants  what must soon take place.  He made it known by sending his angel  to his servant John,  who testified to the word of God and to the testimony  of Jesus Christ,  whatever he saw.  Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy,  and blessed are those who hear the words of this prophecy and keep  what is written in it, because the time is near.\nJohn: To the seven churches in Asia. Grace and peace  to you from  the one who is, who was, and who is to come,  and from the seven spirits  , before his throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness,  the firstborn from the dead  and the ruler of the kings of the earth. \nTo him who loves us and has set us free  from our sins by his blood,  and made us a kingdom,  priests  , to his God and Father #— #to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. \nLook, he is coming with the clouds,  \nand every eye will see him,\neven those who pierced him.\nAnd all the tribes   of the earth   ,\nwill mourn over him.   , ,\nSo it is to be. Amen.\n\n“I am the Alpha and the Omega,”  says the Lord God, “the one who is, who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.”\n\nI, John, your brother and partner in the affliction,  kingdom,  and endurance  that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.  I was in the Spirit  , on the Lord’s day, and I heard a loud voice behind me like a trumpet  saying, “Write   on a scroll   what you see and send it to the seven churches: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.”\nThen I turned to see whose voice  it was that spoke to me. When I turned I saw seven golden lampstands,  and among the lampstands was one like the Son of Man,  , dressed in a robe  and with a golden sash wrapped around his chest.  The hair of his head was white as wool #— #white as snow   #— #and his eyes like a fiery flame.  His feet were like fine bronze as it is fired in a furnace,  and his voice like the sound of cascading  waters.  He had seven stars in his right hand; a sharp double-edged sword came from his mouth,  and his face was shining like the sun at full strength. \nWhen I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man.  He laid his right hand on me and said, “Don’t be afraid. I am the First and the Last,   and the Living One.   I was dead, but look #— #I am alive forever and ever,   and I hold the keys   of death and Hades. Therefore write what you have seen,   what is, and what will take place after this. The mystery   of the seven stars you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this: The seven stars are the angels   of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands   are the seven churches.",

You have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not,   and you have found them to be liars.   I know that you have persevered and endured hardships for the sake of my name,   and you have not grown weary. But I have this against you: You have abandoned the love you had at first.   Remember then how far you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first.   Otherwise, I will come to you   and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent. Yet you do have this: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.\n“Let anyone who has ears to hear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers, I will give   the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in   the paradise of God.  \n\n“Write to the angel of the church in Smyrna: Thus says the First and the Last,   the one who was dead and came to life: I know your   affliction and poverty, but you are rich. I know the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.   Don’t be afraid of what you are about to suffer. Look, the devil   is about to throw some of you into prison to test you, and you will experience affliction for ten days.   Be faithful to the point of death,   and I will give you the crown   of life.  \n“Let anyone who has ears to hear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who conquers will never be harmed by the second death.  \n\n“Write to the angel of the church in Pergamum: Thus says the one who has the sharp, double-edged sword:   I know   where you live #— #where Satan’s throne is. Yet you are holding on to my name and did not deny your faith in me,   , even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness   who was put to death among you, where Satan lives. But I have a few things against you. You have some there who hold to the teaching of Balaam,   who taught Balak to place a stumbling block   in front of the Israelites: to eat meat sacrificed to idols   and to commit sexual immorality.   In the same way, you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.   So repent! Otherwise, I will come to you quickly   and fight against them with the sword of my mouth.  \n“Let anyone who has ears to hear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers, I will give some of the hidden manna.   , I will also give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name   is inscribed that no one knows except the one who receives it.\n\n“Write to the angel of the church in Thyatira: Thus says the Son of God,   the one whose eyes are like a fiery flame and whose feet are like fine bronze:   I know your works #— #your love, faithfulness,   service, and endurance.   I know that your last works are greater than the first. But I have this against you: You tolerate the woman Jezebel,   who calls herself a prophetess and teaches and deceives my servants to commit sexual immorality and to eat meat sacrificed to idols.   I gave her time to repent,   but she does not want to repent of her sexual immorality.   Look, I will throw her into a sickbed   and those who commit adultery with her   into great affliction.   Unless they repent of her   works, I will strike her children dead.   , Then all the churches will know that I am the one who examines minds and hearts,   and I will give to each of you according to your works.   I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who haven’t known “the so-called secrets   , of Satan”   #— #as they say #— #I am not putting any other burden on you.   Only hold on to what you have until I come.   The one who conquers and who keeps my works to the end: I will give him authority over the nations —\nand he will rule   , them with an iron scepter;\nhe will shatter them like pottery   , —\njust as I have received this from my Father. I will also give him the morning star.  \n“Let anyone who has ears to hear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.",

Remember, then, what you have received and heard; keep it, and repent. If you are not alert, I will come   like a thief, and you have no idea at what hour I will come upon you.   But you have a few people   in Sardis who have not defiled   their clothes,   and they will walk with me in white, because they are worthy.\n“In the same way, the one who conquers   will be dressed in white clothes,   and I will never erase his name from the book of life   but will acknowledge his name before my Father and before his angels.  \n“Let anyone who has ears to hear listen   to what the Spirit says   to the churches.\n\n“Write to the angel of the church in Philadelphia: Thus says the Holy One, the true one,   the one who has the key of David, who opens and no one will close, and who closes and no one opens:   I know your works. Look, I have placed before you an open door that no one can close because you have but little power; yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.   Note this: I will make those from the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews and are not, but are lying #— #I will make them come and bow down at your feet,   and they will know that I have loved you.   Because you have kept my command to endure, I will also keep you from the hour of testing   that is going to come on the whole world to test those who live on the earth.   I am coming soon.   Hold on to what you have,   so that no one takes your crown.  \n“The one who conquers I will make a pillar   in the temple of my God, and he will never go out again. I will write on him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God #— #the new Jerusalem,   which comes down out of heaven from my God #— #and my new name.  \n“Let anyone who has ears to hear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.\n\n“Write to the angel of the church in Laodicea: Thus says the Amen,   the faithful and true witness, the originator   , of God’s creation: I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish that you were cold or hot. So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I am going to vomit   you out of my mouth. For you say, ‘I’m rich; I have become wealthy and need nothing,’   and you don’t realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked. I advise you to buy from me gold refined in the fire so that you may be rich,   white clothes so that you may be dressed and your shameful nakedness not be exposed,   and ointment to spread on your eyes so that you may see. As many as I love, I rebuke and discipline.   So be zealous and repent. See! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.  \n“To the one who conquers I will give the right to sit with me on my throne,   just as I also conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne.\n“Let anyone who has ears to hear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.”",

The first living creature was like a lion; the second living creature was like an ox; the third living creature had a face like a man; and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.  Each of the four living creatures had six wings;  they were covered with eyes around and inside.

I wept and wept because no one was found worthy to open  the scroll or even to look in it. Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep.

He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God  sent into all the earth. He went and took the scroll out of the right hand of the one seated on the throne.\n\nWhen he took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp  and golden bowls  filled with incense,  which are the prayers of the saints. And they sang a new song: \nYou are worthy to take the scroll\nand to open its seals,\nbecause you were slaughtered,\nand you purchased   people \nfor God by your blood\nfrom every tribe and language\nand people and nation. \nYou made them a kingdom \nand priests to our God, \nand they will reign on the earth.\n\nThen I looked and heard the voice of many angels around the throne, and also of the living creatures and of the elders. Their number was countless thousands, plus thousands of thousands.  They said with a loud voice,\nWorthy is the Lamb who was slaughtered\nto receive power and riches\nand wisdom and strength\nand honor and glory and blessing!\nI heard every creature in heaven, on earth, under the earth,  on the sea, and everything in them say, \nBlessing and honor and glory and power\nbe to the one seated on the throne,\nand to the Lamb, forever and ever!\nThe four living creatures said, “Amen,” and the elders fell down and worshiped.",

And a large sword was given to him. \n\nWhen he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come! ” And I looked, and there was a black horse.  Its rider held a set of scales in his hand.  Then I heard something like a voice among the four living creatures say, “A quart of wheat for a denarius,  and three quarts of barley for a denarius,  but do not harm the oil and the wine.” \n\nWhen he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come! ” And I looked, and there was a pale green  horse. Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following after him.  They were  given authority  over a fourth of the earth, to kill by the sword, by famine, by plague, and by the wild animals of the earth. \n\nWhen he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slaughtered because of the word of God and the testimony they had given.  , They cried out with a loud voice, “Lord,  the one who is holy and true,  how long until you judge those who live on the earth and avenge our blood?   ” So they were each given a white robe, and they were told to rest a little while longer until the number would be completed of their fellow servants and their brothers and sisters, who were going to be killed just as they had been.\n\nThen I saw him open  the sixth seal. A violent earthquake occurred;  the sun turned black like sackcloth  made of hair; the entire moon  became like blood;  the stars  of heaven fell to the earth as a fig tree drops its unripe figs when shaken by a high wind; the sky was split apart like a scroll being rolled up;  and every mountain and island was moved from its place. \nThen the kings of the earth, the nobles, the generals, the rich, the powerful, and every slave and free person hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains.  And they said to the mountains and to the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us  from the face of the one seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb, because the great day of their  wrath has come! And who is able to stand? ”",

Then I saw the seven angels who stand in the presence of God;  seven trumpets were given to them.  Another angel, with a golden incense burner, came and stood at the altar. He was given a large amount of incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar in front of the throne.  The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up in the presence of God from the angel’s hand. The angel took the incense burner, filled it with fire from the altar,  and hurled it to the earth; there were peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake. \n\nAnd the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to blow them.\n\nThe first angel blew his trumpet, and hail and fire, mixed with blood, were hurled to the earth.  So a third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up. \n\nThe second angel blew his trumpet, and something like a great mountain ablaze with fire was hurled into the sea.  So a third of the sea became blood,  a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.\n\nThe third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from heaven.  It fell on a third of the rivers and springs of water. The name of the star is Wormwood,  and a third of the waters became wormwood. So, many of the people died from the waters, because they had been made bitter.\n\nThe fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened. A third of the day was without light and also a third of the night. \nI looked and heard an eagle  flying high overhead, crying out in a loud voice, “Woe!  Woe!

He opened the shaft to the abyss, and smoke came up out of the shaft like smoke from a great  furnace  so that the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the shaft.  Then locusts came out of the smoke on to the earth,  and power  was given to them  like the power that scorpions have on the earth.  They were told not to harm the grass of the earth, or any green plant, or any tree,  but only those people who do not have God’s seal on their foreheads.  They were not permitted to kill them but were to torment them for five months; their torment is like the torment caused by a scorpion when it stings someone. In those days people will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, but death will flee from them. \nThe appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle.  Something like golden crowns was on their heads; their faces were like human faces; they had hair like women’s hair; their teeth were like lions’ teeth;  they had chests like iron breastplates; the sound of their wings was like the sound of many chariots with horses rushing into battle; and they had tails with stingers like scorpions, so that with their tails they had the power to harm people for five months. They had as their king  the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon,  , and in Greek he has the name Apollyon. \nThe first woe has passed. There are still two more woes to come after this. \n\nThe sixth angel blew his trumpet. From the four  horns of the golden altar  that is before God, I heard a voice say to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels  bound at the great river Euphrates.”  So the four angels who were prepared for the hour, day, month, and year  were released to kill a third  of the human race. The number of mounted troops was two hundred million;  I heard their number. This is how I saw the horses and their riders in the vision: They had breastplates that were fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow. The heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and from their mouths came fire, smoke, and sulfur.  A third of the human race was killed by these three plagues #— #by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur that came from their mouths. For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails, because their tails, which resemble snakes, have heads that inflict injury.\nThe rest of the people, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands  to stop worshiping demons  and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood,  which cannot see, hear, or walk.  And they did not repent of their murders, their sorceries, their sexual immorality, or their thefts.",

He put his right foot on the sea, his left on the land, and he called out with a loud voice like a roaring lion. When he cried out, the seven thunders raised their voices. And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write, but I heard a voice from heaven, saying, “Seal up what the seven thunders said,  and do not write it down! ”\nThen the angel that I had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven. He swore by the one who lives forever and ever,  who created heaven and what is in it, the earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it, “There will no longer be a delay, but in the days when the seventh angel  will blow his trumpet, then the mystery of God  will be completed, as he announced to his servants the prophets.” \nThen the voice that I heard from heaven spoke to me again and said, “Go, take the scroll that lies open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.”\nSo I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll. He said to me, “Take and eat it; it will be bitter in your stomach, but it will be as sweet as honey in your mouth.” \nThen I took the little scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I ate it, my stomach became bitter.  And they said to me, “You must prophesy again about  many peoples, nations, languages, and kings.”",

But exclude the courtyard outside the temple.  Don’t measure it, because it is given to the nations,  , and they will trample the holy city  for forty-two months.  I will grant  my two witnesses authority to prophesy for 1,260 days, dressed in sackcloth.”  These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord  of the earth.  If anyone wants to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and consumes their enemies;  if anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this way. They have authority to close up the sky so that it does not rain during the days of their prophecy.  They also have power over the waters to turn them into blood  and to strike the earth with every plague whenever they want. \n\nWhen they finish their testimony, the beast  that comes up out of the abyss  will make war on them, conquer them, and kill them. Their dead bodies  , will lie in the main street  of the great city,  which figuratively  is called Sodom  and Egypt,  where also their Lord was crucified. And some of  the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations  will view their bodies for three and a half days and not permit their bodies to be put into a tomb.  Those who live on the earth will gloat  over them and celebrate and send gifts to one another because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth.\n\nBut after three and a half days, the breath  of life  from God entered them, and they stood on their feet. Great fear fell on those who saw them. Then they heard  a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here.” They went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies watched them.  At that moment a violent earthquake took place,  a tenth of the city fell, and seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake. The survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.\nThe second woe  has passed. Take note: The third woe is coming soon!\n\nThe seventh angel blew his trumpet,  and there were loud voices in heaven saying,\nThe kingdom of the world has become the kingdom\nof our Lord and of his Christ,\nand he will reign forever and ever. \nThe twenty-four elders, who were seated before God on their thrones, fell facedown and worshiped God, saying,\nWe give you thanks, Lord God, the Almighty,\nwho is and who was,  ,\nbecause you have taken your great power\nand have begun to reign. \nThe nations were angry, \nbut your wrath has come.\nThe time has come\nfor the dead to be judged\nand to give the reward\nto your servants the prophets, \nto the saints, and to those who fear your name,\nboth small and great, \nand the time has come to destroy\nthose who destroy the earth.\n\nThen the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant  appeared in his temple. There were flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder,  an earthquake,  and severe hail.",

The woman fled into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared by God,  to be nourished there  for 1,260 days. \n\nThen war broke out in heaven: Michael  and his angels fought against the dragon. The dragon and his angels also fought, but he could not prevail,  and there was no place for them in heaven any longer.  So the great dragon was thrown out #— #the ancient serpent,  who is called the devil and Satan,  the one who deceives the whole world.  He was thrown to earth, and his angels with him.  Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say,\nThe salvation and the power\nand the kingdom of our God\nand the authority of his Christ\nhave now come, \nbecause the accuser  of our brothers and sisters,\nwho accuses them\nbefore our God day and night,\nhas been thrown down.\nThey conquered him\nby the blood of the Lamb \nand by the word of their testimony; \nfor they did not love their lives\nto the point of death. \nTherefore rejoice, you heavens,\nand you who dwell in them! \nWoe to the earth and the sea,\nbecause the devil has come down to you\nwith great fury,\nbecause he knows his time is short.\n\nWhen the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he persecuted  the woman who had given birth to the male child. The woman was given two wings of a great eagle,  so that she could fly from the serpent’s presence to her place in the wilderness, where she was nourished for a time, times, and half a time.  From his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river flowing after the woman, to sweep her away with a flood. But the earth helped the woman. The earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river that the dragon had spewed from his mouth. So the dragon was furious with the woman and went off to wage war  against the rest of her offspring  ,  #— #those who keep the commands of God  and hold firmly to the testimony about Jesus. \n\nThe dragon  stood on the sand of the sea.",

One of its heads appeared to be fatally wounded, but its fatal wound was healed.\nThe whole earth was amazed and followed the beast.  They worshiped the dragon  because he gave authority to the beast. And they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast?  Who is able to wage war against it? ”\nThe beast was given a mouth to utter boasts and blasphemies.  It was allowed to exercise authority  , for forty-two months.  It began to speak  blasphemies against God: to blaspheme his name and his dwelling #— #those who dwell in heaven. And it was permitted to wage war against the saints and to conquer them.  It was also given authority  over every tribe, people, language, and nation.  All those who live on the earth will worship it, everyone whose name was not written from the foundation of the world in the book  of life  of the Lamb who was slaughtered.  ,\nIf anyone has ears to hear, let him listen. \nIf anyone is to be taken captive,\ninto captivity he goes.\nIf anyone is to be killed  with a sword,\nwith a sword he will be killed. \nThis calls for endurance  and faithfulness from the saints. \n\nThen I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; it had two horns like a lamb,  , but it spoke like a dragon. It exercises all the authority of the first beast on its behalf and compels the earth and those who live on it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed. It also performs great signs,  even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in front of people.  It deceives those who live on the earth  because of the signs that it is permitted to perform in the presence of the beast,  telling those who live on the earth to make an image  of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived. It was permitted to give breath  to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast could both speak and cause whoever would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.  And it makes everyone #— #small and great, rich and poor, free and slave #— #to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead,  so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark: the beast’s name or the number of its name.\nThis calls for wisdom:  , Let the one who has understanding calculate  the number of the beast, because it is the number of a person. Its number is 666.",

      "chapter_text": "Then I looked, and there was the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion,  and with him were 144,000 who had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads.  I heard a sound  from heaven like the sound of cascading waters  and like the rumbling of loud thunder. The sound I heard was like harpists playing on their harps.  They sang  a new song  before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders,  but no one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth. These are the ones who have not defiled themselves with women, since they remained virgins.  These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were redeemed  from humanity as the firstfruits  for God and the Lamb. No lie was found in their mouths; they are blameless. \n\nThen I saw another angel  flying high overhead,  with the eternal gospel to announce to the inhabitants of the earth #— #to every nation, tribe, language, and people.  He spoke with a loud voice:  “Fear God  and give him glory,  because the hour of his judgment has come.  Worship the one who made heaven and earth,  the sea and the springs of water.”\nAnd another, a second angel, followed, saying, “It has fallen, Babylon the Great  has fallen.  She made all the nations drink the wine of her sexual immorality,  which brings wrath.” \nAnd another, a third angel, followed them and spoke with a loud voice: “If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, he will also drink the wine of God’s wrath, which is poured full strength into the cup of his anger.  He will be tormented with fire and sulfur  in the sight of the holy angels and in the sight of the Lamb, and the smoke of their torment will go up forever and ever.  There is no rest  , day or night for those who worship the beast and its image, or anyone who receives the mark  of its name. This calls for endurance from the saints,  who keep God’s commands and their faith in Jesus.” \nThen I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.” \n“Yes,” says the Spirit, “so they will rest from their labors, since their works follow them.”\n\nThen I looked, and there was a white cloud, and one like the Son of Man  , was seated on the cloud, with a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. Another angel came out of the temple, crying out in a loud voice to the one who was seated on the cloud, “Use your sickle and reap, for the time to reap has come, since the harvest of the earth is ripe.”  So the one seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.\nThen another angel who also had a sharp sickle came out of the temple in heaven. Yet another angel, who had authority over fire, came from the altar, and he called with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, “Use your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from the vineyard of the earth, because its grapes have ripened.” So the angel swung his sickle at the earth and gathered the grapes from the vineyard of the earth, and he threw them into the great winepress of God’s wrath.  Then the press was trampled outside the city, and blood flowed out of the press up to the horses’ bridles for about 180 miles.  ,",

It turned to blood like that of a dead person, and all life in the sea died. \n\nThe third  poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood.  I heard the angel of the waters say,\nYou are just,\nthe Holy One,  who is and who was, \nbecause you have passed judgment on these things.\nBecause they poured out\nthe blood of the saints and the prophets, \nyou have given them blood to drink;\nthey deserve it! \nI heard the altar say,\nYes, Lord God, the Almighty,\ntrue and just are your judgments. \n\nThe fourth  poured out his bowl on the sun. It was allowed to scorch people with fire, and people were scorched by the intense heat. So they blasphemed the name of God,  who has the power  over these plagues, and they did not repent and give him glory. \n\nThe fifth  poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast,  and its kingdom was plunged into darkness.  People  gnawed their tongues because of their pain and blasphemed the God of heaven  because of their pains and their sores, but they did not repent of their works.\n\nThe sixth  poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates,  and its water was dried up  to prepare the way for the kings from the east. Then I saw three unclean spirits like frogs  coming from the dragon’s mouth,  from the beast’s mouth,  and from the mouth of the false prophet.  For they are demonic spirits performing signs,  who travel to the kings of the whole world to assemble them  for the battle on the great day of God, the Almighty.  “Look, I am coming like a thief. Blessed   is the one who is alert and remains clothed   , so that he may not go around naked and people see his shame.”   So they assembled the kings at the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon.  ,\n\nThen the seventh  poured out his bowl into the air,  and a loud voice came out of the temple  , from the throne, saying, “It is done! ” There were flashes of lightning, rumblings, and peals of thunder. And a severe earthquake occurred like no other since people have been on the earth, so great was the quake.  The great city  split into three parts, and the cities of the nations  fell. Babylon the Great was remembered in God’s presence; he gave her the cup filled with the wine of his fierce anger.  Every island fled, and the mountains disappeared.  Enormous hailstones, each weighing about a hundred pounds,  fell from the sky on people, and they blasphemed God  for the plague of hail because that plague was extremely severe.",

On her forehead was written a name, a mystery:  BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND OF THE DETESTABLE THINGS OF THE EARTH. Then I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses to Jesus.  When I saw her, I was greatly astonished.\n\nThen the angel said to me, “Why are you astonished? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast, with the seven heads and the ten horns, that carries her. The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up from the abyss  and go to destruction.  Those who live on the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world  will be astonished when they see the beast that was, and is not, and is to come.  This calls for a mind that has wisdom.  ,\n“The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated. They are also seven kings: Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he comes, he must remain for only a little while. The beast that was and is not, is itself an eighth king, but it belongs to the seven and is going to destruction. The ten horns you saw are ten kings  who have not yet received a kingdom, but they will receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour.  These have one purpose, and they give their power and authority to the beast. These will make war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings.  Those with him are called, chosen, and faithful.” \nHe also said to me, “The waters you saw,  where the prostitute was seated, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.  The ten horns you saw, and the beast, will hate the prostitute.  They will make her desolate and naked, devour her flesh, and burn her up with fire.  For God has put it into their hearts to carry out his plan by having one purpose  and to give their kingdom  to the beast until the words of God are fulfilled.  And the woman you saw is the great city that has royal power over the kings of the earth.”",

He called out in a mighty voice:\nIt has fallen, \nBabylon the Great has fallen! \nShe has become a home for demons,\na haunt for every unclean spirit,\na haunt for every unclean bird,\nand a haunt  for every unclean and despicable beast.  ,\nFor all the nations have drunk \nthe wine of her sexual immorality,\nwhich brings wrath. \nThe kings of the earth\nhave committed sexual immorality with her,\nand the merchants of the earth\nhave grown wealthy from her sensuality and excess. \nThen I heard another voice from heaven:\nCome out of her, my people,\nso that you will not share in her sins \nor receive any of her plagues.\nFor her sins are piled up  to heaven, \nand God has remembered her crimes. \nPay her back the way she also paid, \nand double it according to her works. \nIn the cup in which she mixed, \nmix a double portion for her.\nAs much as she glorified herself and indulged her sensual and excessive ways,\ngive her that much torment and grief.\nFor she says in her heart,\n“I sit as a queen;\nI am not a widow,\nand I will never see grief.” \nFor this reason her plagues will come in just one day —\ndeath and grief and famine. \nShe will be burned up with fire, \nbecause the Lord God who judges   her is mighty. \n\nThe kings of the earth who have committed sexual immorality and shared her sensual and excessive ways will weep and mourn over her when they see the smoke from her burning. They will stand far off in fear of her torment,  saying,\nWoe, woe, the great city, \nBabylon, the mighty city!\nFor in a single hour\nyour judgment has come.\n\nThe merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargo any longer #— # cargo of gold, silver, jewels, and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk, and scarlet; all kinds of fragrant wood products; objects of ivory; objects of expensive wood, brass,  iron, and marble; cinnamon, spice,  incense, myrrh,  and frankincense; wine, olive oil, fine flour, and grain; cattle and sheep; horses and carriages; and slaves #— #human lives. \nThe fruit you craved has left you.\nAll your splendid and glamorous things are gone;\nthey will never find them again.\n\nThe merchants of these things, who became rich from her, will stand far off in fear of her torment, weeping and mourning, saying,\nWoe, woe, the great city,\ndressed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet,\nadorned with gold, jewels, and pearls; \nfor in a single hour\nsuch fabulous wealth was destroyed!\n\nAnd every shipmaster, seafarer, the sailors, and all who do business by sea, stood far off as they watched the smoke from her burning and kept crying out, “Who was like the great city? ”  They threw dust on their heads and kept crying out, weeping, and mourning, \nWoe, woe, the great city, \nwhere all those who have ships on the sea\nbecame rich from her wealth;\nfor in a single hour she was destroyed.\nRejoice over her, heaven,\nand you saints, apostles, and prophets, \nbecause God has pronounced on her the judgment  she passed on you!\n\nThen a mighty angel  picked up a stone like a large millstone and threw it into the sea, saying,\nIn this way, Babylon the great city\nwill be thrown down violently \nand never be found again. \nThe sound of harpists, musicians,\nflutists, and trumpeters\nwill never be heard in you again; \nno craftsman of any trade\nwill ever be found in you again;\nthe sound of a mill\nwill never be heard in you again;\nthe light of a lamp\nwill never shine in you again;\nand the voice of a groom and bride\nwill never be heard in you again. \nAll this will happen\nbecause your merchants\nwere the nobility of the earth,\nbecause all the nations were deceived\nby your sorcery.\nIn her was found the blood of prophets and saints, \nand of all those slaughtered on the earth.",

Hallelujah! \nA voice came from the throne, saying,\nPraise our God,\nall his servants, and the ones who fear him,\nboth small and great! \nThen I heard something like the voice of a vast multitude, like the sound of cascading waters,  and like the rumbling of loud thunder, saying,\nHallelujah, because our Lord God, the Almighty,\nreigns! \nLet us be glad, rejoice, and give him glory, \nbecause the marriage of the Lamb has come,\nand his bride has prepared herself. \nShe was given fine linen to wear, bright and pure. \nFor the fine linen represents the righteous acts of the saints. \nThen he  said to me,  “Write: Blessed are those invited to the marriage feast  of the Lamb! ” He also said to me, “These words of God are true.”  Then I fell at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, “Don’t do that!  I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers and sisters who hold firmly to the testimony of Jesus.  Worship God, because the testimony of Jesus is the spirit  of prophecy.”\n\nThen I saw heaven opened,  and there was a white horse. Its rider is called Faithful and True,  and with justice he judges and makes war.  His eyes were like a fiery flame,  and many crowns  were on his head.  He had a name written that no one knows except himself.  He wore a robe dipped in blood,  and his name is called the Word of God.  The armies that were in heaven followed him on white horses, wearing pure white linen. A sharp  sword  came from his mouth, so that he might strike the nations with it.  He will rule  them with an iron rod.  He will also trample the winepress of the fierce anger of God,  the Almighty. And he has a name written on his robe and on his thigh: KING OF KINGS AND L ORD OF L ORDS. \n\nThen I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he called out in a loud voice, saying to all the birds flying high overhead, “Come, gather together for the great supper of God, so that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of military commanders, the flesh of the mighty, the flesh of horses and of their riders, and the flesh of everyone, both free and slave, small and great.” \nThen I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies  gathered together to wage war  against the rider on the horse and against his army. But the beast was taken prisoner, and along with it the false prophet, who had performed the signs in its presence. He deceived those who accepted the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image with these signs.  Both of them were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.  The rest were killed with the sword that came from the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds ate their fill of their flesh.",

He threw him into the abyss, closed it, and put a seal on it  so that he would no longer deceive the nations  until the thousand years were completed. After that, he must be released for a short time.\n\nThen I saw thrones, and people seated on them who were given authority to judge.  I also saw the souls of those  who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus  and because of the word of God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and who had not accepted the mark on their foreheads or their hands.  They came to life  and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.  The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed.\nThis is the first resurrection. Blessed  and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection! The second death  has no power  over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him for a thousand years. \n\nWhen the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations  at the four corners of the earth,  Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle.  Their number is like the sand of the sea.  They came up across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the encampment of the saints, the beloved city.  Then fire came down from heaven  and consumed them.  The devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet are,  and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever. \n\nThen I saw a great white throne and one seated on it. Earth and heaven fled from his presence, and no place was found for them.  I also saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened.  Another book was opened, which is the book of life,  and the dead were judged according to their works  by what was written in the books. Then the sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades  gave up the dead that were in them; each one was judged according to their works. Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire.  This is the second death, the lake of fire. And anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.",

They will be his peoples,  , and God himself will be with them and will be their God.  He will wipe away every tear from their eyes.  Death will be no more;  grief, crying, and pain will be no more,  because the previous things  have passed away. \nThen the one seated on the throne said, “Look, I am making everything new.” He also said, “Write, because these words  are faithful and true.”  Then he said to me, “It is done!  I am the Alpha and the Omega,  the beginning and the end.  I will freely give to the thirsty  from the spring of the water of life.  The one who conquers  will inherit these things, and I will be his God, and he will be my son.  But the cowards, faithless,  detestable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars   #— #their share will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur,  which is the second death.” \n\nThen one of the seven angels, who had held the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues,  came and spoke with me: “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.” He then carried me away in the Spirit  , to a great, high mountain  and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, arrayed with God’s glory.  Her radiance was like a precious jewel, like a jasper stone, clear as crystal. The city had a massive high wall, with twelve gates. Twelve angels were at the gates; the names of the twelve tribes of Israel’s sons were inscribed on the gates. There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.  The city wall had twelve foundations, and the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb were on the foundations.\nThe one who spoke with me had a golden measuring rod  to measure the city, its gates, and its wall.  The city is laid out in a square; its length and width are the same. He measured the city with the rod at 12,000 stadia .  Its length, width, and height are equal. Then he measured its wall, 144 cubits according to human measurement, which the angel used. The building material of its wall was jasper, and the city was pure gold clear as glass. The foundations of the city wall were adorned with every kind of jewel:  the first foundation is jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst. The twelve gates are twelve pearls; each individual gate was made of a single pearl. The main street  of the city was pure gold, transparent as glass.\nI did not see a temple in it, because the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, because the glory of God illuminates it, and its lamp is the Lamb.  The nations will walk by its light,  and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.  , Its gates will never close by day because it will never be night there.  They will bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.  , Nothing unclean will ever enter it,  nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those written in the Lamb’s book of life.",

They will see his face,  and his name will be on their foreheads.  Night will be no more;  people will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, because the Lord God will give them light,  and they will reign forever and ever.\n\nThen he said to me, “These words are faithful  and true.  The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets,  has sent his angel to show his servants what must soon take place.” \n“Look, I am coming soon!   Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.”  \nI, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. When I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had shown them to me. But he said to me, “Don’t do that! I am a fellow servant with you, your brothers the prophets, and those who keep the words of this book. Worship God! ” \nThen he said to me, “Don’t seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, because the time is near.  Let the unrighteous go on in unrighteousness; let the filthy still be filthy; let the righteous go on in righteousness; let the holy still be holy.” \n“Look, I am coming soon, and my reward is with me   to repay each person according to his work.   I am the Alpha and the Omega,   the first and the last,   the beginning and the end.  \n“Blessed   are those who wash their robes,   so that they may have the right to the tree of life and may enter the city by the gates. Outside are the dogs,   the sorcerers, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.  \n“I, Jesus, have sent my angel to attest these things to you for the churches. I am the Root   and descendant of David,   the bright morning star.”  \nBoth the Spirit and the bride say, “Come! ” Let anyone who hears, say, “Come! ” Let the one who is thirsty come. Let the one who desires take the water of life freely. \nI testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book. And if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share of the tree of life and the holy city, which are written about in this book. \nHe who testifies about these things  says, “Yes, I am coming soon.”\nAmen! Come, Lord Jesus! \nThe grace of the Lord Jesus  be with everyone.  Amen.",
