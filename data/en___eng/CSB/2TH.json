It is clear evidence of God’s righteous  judgment  that you will be counted worthy of God’s kingdom, for which you also are suffering,  since it is just for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you and to give relief to you who are afflicted, along with us. This will take place at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his powerful angels, when he takes vengeance with flaming fire  on those who don’t know God  and on those who don’t obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.  They will pay the penalty of eternal destruction  from the Lord’s presence  and from his glorious strength  on that day when he comes  to be glorified  by his saints  and to be marveled at by all those who have believed, because our testimony among you was believed. In view of this, we always pray for you that our God will make you worthy of his calling,  and by his power fulfill your every desire to do good  and your work produced by faith,  so that the name  of our Lord Jesus will be glorified  by you, and you by him,  according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.",

For that day will not come unless the apostasy  comes first and the man of lawlessness  is revealed, the man doomed to destruction. He opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god  or object of worship,  so that he sits  in God’s temple, proclaiming that he himself is God.\nDon’t you remember that when I was still with you I used to tell you about this? And you know what currently restrains him, so that he will be revealed in his time.  For the mystery of lawlessness  is already at work, but the one now restraining will do so until he is out of the way, and then the lawless one will be revealed. The Lord Jesus will destroy him with the breath of his mouth  and will bring him to nothing at the appearance of his coming. The coming of the lawless one is based on Satan’s working, with every kind of miracle, both signs and wonders serving the lie,  and with every wicked deception among those who are perishing. They perish because they did not accept the love of the truth and so be saved.  For this reason God sends them a strong delusion so that they will believe the lie, so that all will be condemned   #— #those who did not believe  the truth but delighted in unrighteousness.\n\nBut we ought to thank God always for you, brothers and sisters loved by the Lord, because from the beginning  God has chosen  you for salvation through sanctification  by the Spirit and through belief in the truth. He called you to this through our gospel, so that you might obtain the glory  of our Lord Jesus Christ. So then, brothers and sisters, stand firm  and hold to the traditions you were taught,  whether by what we said or what we wrote.\nMay our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who has loved  us and given us eternal encouragement and good hope by grace, encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good work and word.",

May the Lord direct your hearts to God’s love and Christ’s endurance. \n\nNow we command you, brothers and sisters, in the name  of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from every brother or sister  who is idle and does not live  according to the tradition  received  from us. For you yourselves know how you should imitate  us: We were not idle among you; we did not eat  anyone’s food free of charge;  instead, we labored  and toiled,  working  night and day, so that we would not be a burden  to any of you. It is not that we don’t have the right  to support, but we did it to make ourselves an example to you so that you would imitate  us. In fact, when we were with you, this is what we commanded you: “If anyone isn’t willing to work, he should not eat.”  For we hear that there are some among you who are idle. They are not busy but busybodies.  Now we command and exhort such people by the Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and provide for themselves.  But as for you, brothers and sisters, do not grow weary  in doing good.\nIf anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take note of that person; don’t associate with him, so that he may be ashamed. Yet don’t consider him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.\n\nMay the Lord of peace  himself give you peace always in every way.  The Lord be with all of you.  I, Paul, am writing this greeting with my own hand,  which is an authenticating mark in every letter; this is how I write. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.",
