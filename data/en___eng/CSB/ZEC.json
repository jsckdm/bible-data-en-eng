Where are your ancestors now? And do the prophets live forever? But didn’t my words and my statutes that I commanded my servants the prophets overtake your ancestors? ’ ”\nSo the people repented and said, “As the LORD of Armies decided to deal with us for our ways and our deeds, so he has dealt with us.” \n\nOn the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berechiah, son of Iddo:\n\nI looked out in the night and saw a man riding on a chestnut  horse.  He was standing among the myrtle trees in the valley.  Behind him were chestnut, brown, and white horses. I asked, “What are these, my lord? ”\nThe angel who was talking to me replied, “I will show you what they are.”\nThen the man standing among the myrtle trees explained, “They are the ones the LORD has sent to patrol the earth.”\nThey reported to the angel of the LORD standing among the myrtle trees, “We have patrolled the earth, and right now the whole earth is calm and quiet.” \nThen the angel of the LORD responded, “How long, LORD of Armies, will you withhold mercy from Jerusalem and the cities of Judah that you have been angry with these seventy years? ”  The LORD replied with kind and comforting words to the angel who was speaking with me.\nSo the angel who was speaking with me said, “Proclaim: The LORD of Armies says: I am extremely jealous  for Jerusalem and Zion. I am fiercely angry with the nations that are at ease,  for I was a little angry, but they made the destruction worse.  Therefore, this is what the LORD says: In mercy, I have returned to Jerusalem; my house will be rebuilt within it #— #this is the declaration of the LORD of Armies #— #and a measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem. \n“Proclaim further: This is what the LORD of Armies says: My cities will again overflow with prosperity; the LORD will once more comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem.” \n\nThen I looked up and saw four horns.  So I asked the angel who was speaking with me, “What are these? ”\nAnd he said to me, “These are the horns that scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”\nThen the LORD showed me four craftsmen. I asked, “What are they coming to do? ”\nHe replied, “These are the horns that scattered Judah so no one could raise his head. These craftsmen have come to terrify them, to cut off  the horns of the nations that raised a horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.”",

I will send it out,”   #— #this is the declaration of the LORD of Armies #— #“and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by my name. It will stay inside his house and destroy it along with its timbers and stones.” \n\nThen the angel who was speaking with me came forward and told me, “Look up and see what this is that is approaching.”\nSo I asked, “What is it? ”\nHe responded, “It’s a measuring basket  that is approaching.” And he continued, “This is their iniquity  in all the land.” Then a lead cover was lifted, and there was a woman  sitting inside the basket.  “This is Wickedness,” he said. He shoved her down into the basket and pushed the lead weight over its opening. Then I looked up and saw two women approaching with the wind in their wings.

So I inquired of the angel who was speaking with me, “What are these, my lord? ”\nThe angel told me, “These are the four spirits  , of heaven going out after presenting themselves to the Lord of the whole earth. The one with the black horses is going to the land of the north, the white horses are going after them, but the dappled horses are going to the land of the south.” As the strong horses went out, they wanted to go patrol the earth, and the LORD said, “Go, patrol the earth.” So they patrolled the earth. Then he summoned me saying, “See, those going to the land of the north have pacified my Spirit in the northern land.”\n\nThe word of the LORD came to me:  “Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon, and go that same day to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah. Take silver and gold, make a crown,  and place it on the head of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest. You are to tell him: This is what the LORD of Armies says: Here is a man whose name is Branch;  he will branch out from his place and build the LORD’s temple. Yes, he will build the LORD’s temple; he will bear royal splendor  and will sit on his throne and rule. There will be a priest on his throne, and there will be peaceful counsel between the two of them.  The crown will reside in the LORD’s temple as a memorial to Heldai, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen  son of Zephaniah. People who are far off will come and build the LORD’s temple, and you will know that the LORD of Armies has sent me to you. This will happen when you fully obey the LORD your God.”",

Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the resident alien or the poor,  and do not plot evil in your hearts against one another.’  But they refused to pay attention  and turned a stubborn shoulder; they closed their ears so they could not hear.  They made their hearts like a rock so as not to obey the law or the words that the LORD of Armies had sent by his Spirit through the earlier prophets.  Therefore intense anger came from the LORD of Armies. Just as he had called, and they would not listen, so when they called, I would not listen, says the LORD of Armies. I scattered them with a windstorm over all the nations that had not known them, and the land was left desolate behind them, with no one coming or going. They turned a pleasant land into a desolation.”",

Then Jerusalem will be called the Faithful City;  the mountain of the LORD of Armies will be called the Holy Mountain.” The LORD of Armies says this: “Old men and women will again sit along the streets of Jerusalem, each with a staff in hand because of advanced age. The streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in them.” The LORD of Armies says this: “Though it may seem impossible to the remnant of this people in those days, should it also seem impossible to me? ” #— #this is the declaration of the LORD of Armies. The LORD of Armies says this: “I will save my people from the land of the east and the land of the west.  I will bring them back  to live in Jerusalem. They will be my people, and I will be their faithful and righteous God.” \nThe LORD of Armies says this: “Let your hands be strong, you who now hear these words that the prophets spoke when the foundations were laid for the rebuilding of the temple, the house of the LORD of Armies. For prior to those days neither people nor animals had wages. There was no safety from the enemy for anyone who came or went, for I turned everyone against his neighbor. But now, I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days” #— #this is the declaration of the LORD of Armies. “For they will sow in peace: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce, and the skies will yield their dew. I will give the remnant of this people all these things as an inheritance.  As you have been a curse among the nations,  house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you, and you will be a blessing.  Don’t be afraid; let your hands be strong.” For the LORD of Armies says this: “As I resolved to treat you badly when your ancestors provoked me to anger, and I did not relent,” says the LORD of Armies, “so I have resolved again in these days to do what is good to Jerusalem and the house of Judah.  Don’t be afraid. These are the things you must do: Speak truth to one another; make true and sound decisions within your city gates. Do not plot evil  in your hearts against your neighbor,  and do not love perjury,  for I hate all this” #— #this is the LORD’s declaration.\nThen the word of the LORD of Armies came to me: The LORD of Armies says this: “The fast of the fourth month,  the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth  will become times of joy, gladness, and cheerful festivals for the house of Judah. Therefore, love truth and peace.” The LORD of Armies says this: “Peoples will yet come, the residents of many cities; the residents of one city will go to another, saying: Let’s go at once to plead for the LORD’s favor and to seek the LORD of Armies. I am also going. Many peoples and strong nations will come to seek the LORD of Armies in Jerusalem and to plead for the LORD’s favor.”  The LORD of Armies says this: “In those days, ten men from nations of every language will grab the robe of a Jewish man tightly, urging: Let us go with you,  for we have heard that God is with you.”",

Those who buy them slaughter them but are not punished.  Those who sell them say, ‘Blessed be the LORD because I have become rich!’ Even their own shepherds have no compassion for them. Indeed, I will no longer have compassion on the inhabitants of the land” #— #this is the LORD’s declaration. “Instead, I will turn everyone over to his neighbor and his king. They will devastate the land, and I will not rescue it from their hand.” \nSo I shepherded the flock intended for slaughter, the oppressed of the flock.  I took two staffs, calling one Favor  and the other Union, and I shepherded the flock. In one month I got rid of three shepherds. I became impatient with them, and they also detested me. Then I said, “I will no longer shepherd you. Let what is dying die, and let what is perishing perish; let the rest devour each other’s flesh.” Next I took my staff called Favor and cut it in two, annulling the covenant I had made with all the peoples. It was annulled on that day, and so the oppressed of the flock  who were watching me knew that it was the word of the LORD. Then I said to them, “If it seems right to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them.” So they weighed my wages, thirty pieces of silver. \n“Throw it to the potter,”  the LORD said to me #— #this magnificent price I was valued by them. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw it into the house of the LORD, to the potter.  , Then I cut in two my second staff, Union, annulling the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.\nThe LORD also said to me, “Take the equipment of a foolish shepherd. I am about to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for those who are perishing, and he will not seek the lost  or heal the broken. He will not sustain the healthy,  but he will devour the flesh of the fat sheep  and tear off their hooves.\nWoe to the worthless shepherd\nwho deserts the flock! \nMay a sword strike  his arm\nand his right eye!\nMay his arm wither away\nand his right eye go completely blind! ”",

I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem for battle.  The city will be captured, the houses looted, and the women raped. Half the city will go into exile, but the rest of the people will not be removed from the city.\nThen the LORD will go out to fight against those nations as he fights on a day of battle.  On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives,  which faces Jerusalem on the east. The Mount of Olives will be split in half from east to west, forming a huge valley, so that half the mountain will move to the north and half to the south. You will flee by my mountain valley,  for the valley of the mountains will extend to Azal. You will flee as you fled  from the earthquake in the days of King Uzziah of Judah.  Then the LORD my God will come and all the holy ones  with him.  ,\nOn that day there will be no light; the sunlight and moonlight will diminish.  , , It will be a unique day known only to the LORD,  without day or night, but there will be light at evening.\nOn that day living water will flow out from Jerusalem,  half of it toward the eastern sea  and the other half toward the western sea,  in summer and winter alike. On that day the LORD will become King over the whole earth   #— #the LORD alone, and his name alone.  All the land from Geba  to Rimmon  south of Jerusalem will be changed into a plain. But Jerusalem will be raised up and will remain  on its site from the Benjamin Gate  to the place of the First Gate,  to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses.  People will live there, and never again will there be a curse of complete destruction. So Jerusalem will dwell in security.\nThis will be the plague with which the LORD strikes all the people who have warred against Jerusalem: their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths. On that day a great panic from the LORD will be among them, so that each will seize the hand of another, and the hand of one will rise against the other. Judah will also fight at Jerusalem, and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected: gold, silver, and clothing in great abundance.  The same plague as the previous one will strike  the horses, mules, camels, donkeys, and all the animals that are in those camps.\nThen all the survivors from the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the LORD of Armies, and to celebrate the Festival of Shelters.  Should any of the families of the earth not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of Armies, rain will not fall on them. And if the people  of Egypt will not go up and enter, then rain will not fall on them; this will be the plague the LORD inflicts on the nations who do not go up to celebrate the Festival of Shelters. This will be the punishment of Egypt and all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Festival of Shelters.\nOn that day, the words HOLY TO THE LORD will be on the bells of the horses.  The pots in the house of the LORD will be like the sprinkling basins before the altar.
