      "chapter_text": "In the third year of the reign of King Jehoiakim  of Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar  , of Babylon came to Jerusalem and laid siege to it. The Lord handed King Jehoiakim of Judah over to him, along with some of the vessels from the house of God.  Nebuchadnezzar carried them to the land of Babylon,  , to the house of his god,  and put the vessels in the treasury of his god.\nThe king ordered Ashpenaz, his chief eunuch, to bring some of the Israelites from the royal family  and from the nobility #— # young men without any physical defect, good-looking, suitable for instruction in all wisdom,  knowledgeable, perceptive, and capable of serving in the king’s palace.  He was to teach them the Chaldean language  and literature. The king assigned them daily provisions from the royal food and from the wine that he drank.  They were to be trained for three years, and at the end of that time they were to attend the king.  , Among them, from the Judahites, were Daniel,  Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. The chief eunuch gave them names; he gave the name Belteshazzar to Daniel, Shadrach to Hananiah, Meshach to Mishael, and Abednego to Azariah. \n\nDaniel determined that he would not defile himself with the king’s food  or with the wine he drank. So he asked permission from the chief eunuch not to defile himself.  God had granted Daniel kindness and compassion from the chief eunuch,  yet he said to Daniel, “I fear my lord the king, who assigned your food and drink. What if he sees your faces looking thinner than the other young men your age? You would endanger my life  with the king.”\nSo Daniel said to the guard whom the chief eunuch had assigned to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, “Please test your servants for ten days. Let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink. Then examine our appearance and the appearance of the young men who are eating the king’s food, and deal with your servants based on what you see.” He agreed with them about this and tested them for ten days. At the end of ten days they looked better and healthier  than all the young men who were eating the king’s food.  So the guard continued to remove their food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables.\n\nGod gave these four young men knowledge and understanding  in every kind of literature and wisdom. Daniel also understood visions and dreams  of every kind. At the end of the time that the king had said to present them, the chief eunuch presented them to Nebuchadnezzar. The king interviewed them, and among all of them, no one was found equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.  So they began to attend the king. In every matter of wisdom and understanding that the king consulted them about, he found them ten times  , better than all the magicians and mediums  in his entire kingdom. Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.",

      "chapter_text": "In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams  that troubled him, and sleep deserted him.  So the king gave orders to summon the magicians, mediums, sorcerers, and Chaldeans  , to tell the king his dreams. When they came and stood before the king, he said to them, “I have had a dream and am anxious to understand it.”\nThe Chaldeans spoke to the king (Aramaic  , begins here): “May the king live forever.  Tell your servants the dream, and we will give the interpretation.”\nThe king replied to the Chaldeans, “My word is final: If you don’t tell me the dream and its interpretation, you will be torn limb from limb,  and your houses will be made a garbage dump.  But if you make the dream and its interpretation known to me, you’ll receive gifts, a reward, and great honor from me.  So make the dream and its interpretation known to me.”\nThey answered a second time, “May the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will make known the interpretation.”\nThe king replied, “I know for certain you are trying to gain some time, because you see that my word is final. If you don’t tell me the dream, there is one decree for you.  You have conspired to tell me something false or fraudulent until the situation changes. So tell me the dream and I will know you can give me its interpretation.”\nThe Chaldeans answered the king, “No one on earth can make known what the king requests.  Consequently, no king, however great and powerful, has ever asked anything like this of any magician, medium, or Chaldean. What the king is asking is so difficult that no one can make it known to him except the gods, whose dwelling is not with mortals.”  Because of this, the king became violently angry  and gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. The decree was issued that the wise men were to be executed, and they searched for Daniel and his friends, to execute them.\nThen Daniel responded with tact and discretion to Arioch, the captain of the king’s guard,  , who had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon. He asked Arioch, the king’s officer, “Why is the decree from the king so harsh? ”  , Then Arioch explained the situation to Daniel. So Daniel went and asked the king to give him some time, so that he could give the king the interpretation.\nThen Daniel went to his house and told his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah about the matter, urging them to ask the God of the heavens  for mercy  concerning this mystery, so Daniel and his friends would not be destroyed with the rest of Babylon’s wise men.  The mystery was then revealed to Daniel in a vision  at night, and Daniel praised the God of the heavens and declared:\nMay the name of God\nbe praised forever and ever, \nfor wisdom  and power belong to him.\nHe changes the times and seasons;\nhe removes kings and establishes kings. \nHe gives wisdom to the wise\nand knowledge to those\nwho have understanding. \nHe reveals the deep and hidden things;\nhe knows what is in the darkness, \nand light dwells with him. \nI offer thanks and praise to you,\nGod of my ancestors, \nbecause you have given me\nwisdom and power.\nAnd now you have let me know\nwhat we asked of you,\nfor you have let us know \nthe king’s mystery. \n\nTherefore Daniel went to Arioch,  whom the king had assigned to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He came and said to him, “Don’t destroy the wise men of Babylon! Bring me before the king, and I will give him the interpretation.” \nThen Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king and said to him, “I have found a man among the Judean exiles  who can let the king know the interpretation.”\nThe king said in reply to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar,  “Are you able to tell me the dream I had and its interpretation? ” \nDaniel answered the king, “No wise man, medium, magician, or diviner  is able to make known to the king the mystery he asked about. But there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has let King Nebuchadnezzar know what will happen in the last days.  Your dream and the visions that came into your mind as you lay in bed  were these: Your Majesty, while you were in your bed, thoughts came to your mind about what will happen in the future.  , The revealer of mysteries  has let you know what will happen. As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me,  not because I have more wisdom than anyone living, but in order that the interpretation might be made known to the king, and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind. \n\n“Your Majesty, as you were watching, suddenly a colossal statue appeared. That statue, tall and dazzling, was standing in front of you, and its appearance was terrifying. The head of the statue was pure gold, its chest and arms were silver, its stomach and thighs were bronze, its legs were iron, and its feet were partly iron and partly fired clay. As you were watching, a stone broke off without a hand touching it,  , struck the statue  on its feet of iron and fired clay, and crushed them.  Then the iron, the fired clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were shattered and became like chaff  from the summer threshing floors. The wind carried them away, and not a trace of them could be found. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled  the whole earth.\n“This was the dream; now we will tell the king its interpretation. Your Majesty, you are king of kings.  The God of the heavens has given you sovereignty, power,  strength, and glory. Wherever people live #— #or wild animals, or birds of the sky #— #he has handed them over to you and made you ruler over them all.  You are the head of gold.\n“After you, there will arise another kingdom, inferior to yours, and then another, a third kingdom, of bronze, which will rule the whole earth.  A fourth kingdom will be as strong as iron; for iron crushes and shatters everything, and like iron that smashes, it will crush and smash all the others.  , You saw the feet and toes, partly of a potter’s fired clay and partly of iron #— #it will be a divided kingdom, though some of the strength of iron will be in it. You saw the iron mixed with clay, and that the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly fired clay #— #part of the kingdom will be strong, and part will be brittle. You saw the iron mixed with clay #— #the peoples will mix with one another  but will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with fired clay.\n“In the days of those kings, the God of the heavens will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed,  and this kingdom will not be left to another people. It will crush all these kingdoms  and bring them to an end, but will itself endure forever. You saw a stone  break off from the mountain without a hand touching it,  , and it crushed the iron, bronze, fired clay, silver, and gold. The great God has told the king what will happen in the future.  The dream is certain, and its interpretation reliable.”\n\nThen King Nebuchadnezzar fell facedown, worshiped Daniel, and gave orders to present an offering and incense to him.  The king said to Daniel, “Your God is indeed God of gods, Lord of kings,  and a revealer of mysteries,  since you were able to reveal this mystery.” Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many generous gifts. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon.  At Daniel’s request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego  to manage the province of Babylon. But Daniel remained at the king’s court.",

      "chapter_text": "King Nebuchadnezzar made a gold statue,  ninety feet high and nine feet wide.  He set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.  King Nebuchadnezzar sent word to assemble the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the rulers  of the provinces to attend the dedication of the statue King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the rulers of the provinces assembled for the dedication of the statue the king had set up. Then they stood before the statue Nebuchadnezzar had set up.\nA herald loudly proclaimed, “People of every nation and language, you are commanded: When you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither,  lyre,  harp, drum,  and every kind of music,  you are to fall facedown and worship  the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. But whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire.” \nTherefore, when all the people heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, and every kind of music, people of every nation and language fell down and worshiped the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.\n\nSome Chaldeans  took this occasion to come forward and maliciously accuse  , the Jews. They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “May the king live forever. You as king have issued a decree  that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, drum, and every kind of music must fall down and worship the gold statue. Whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire. There are some Jews you have appointed to manage the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.  These men have ignored you,  the king; they do not serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set up.”\nThen in a furious rage  Nebuchadnezzar gave orders to bring in Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. So these men were brought before the king. Nebuchadnezzar asked them, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, is it true that you don’t serve my gods or worship the gold statue  I have set up? Now if you’re ready, when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, drum, and every kind of music, fall down and worship the statue I made. But if you don’t worship it, you will immediately be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire #— #and who is the god who can rescue you from my power? ” \nShadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied to the king, “Nebuchadnezzar, we don’t need to give you an answer to this question. If the God we serve exists,  then he can rescue  us from the furnace of blazing fire, and he can  rescue us from the power of you, the king. But even if he does not rescue us,  we want you as king to know that we will not serve  your gods  or worship the gold statue you set up.”\nThen Nebuchadnezzar was filled with rage,  and the expression on his face changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He gave orders to heat the furnace seven times more than was customary, and he commanded some of the best soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into the furnace of blazing fire. So these men, in their trousers, robes, head coverings,  and other clothes, were tied up and thrown into the furnace of blazing fire. Since the king’s command was so urgent  , and the furnace extremely hot, the raging flames  killed those men who carried up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego fell, bound, into the furnace of blazing fire.\n\nThen King Nebuchadnezzar jumped up in alarm.  He said to his advisers, “Didn’t we throw three men, bound, into the fire? ”\n“Yes, of course, Your Majesty,” they replied to the king.\nHe exclaimed, “Look! I see four men, not tied, walking around in the fire unharmed;  and the fourth looks like a son of the gods.”  ,\nNebuchadnezzar then approached the door of the furnace of blazing fire and called, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the Most High God #— #come out! ” So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire.  When the satraps, prefects, governors, and the king’s advisers gathered around, they saw that the fire had no effect  on  the bodies of these men: not a hair of their heads was singed, their robes were unaffected, and there was no smell of fire on them.  Nebuchadnezzar exclaimed, “Praise to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego! He sent his angel  , and rescued his servants who trusted in him.  They violated the king’s command and risked their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.  Therefore I issue a decree  that anyone of any people, nation, or language  who says anything offensive against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego will be torn limb from limb and his house made a garbage dump.  For there is no other god who is able to deliver like this.” Then the king rewarded Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.",

I told him the dream: “Belteshazzar, head of the magicians, because I know that you have the spirit of the holy gods  and that no mystery puzzles you,  explain to me the visions of my dream that I saw, and its interpretation. In the visions of my mind as I was lying in bed, I saw this:\nThere was a tree in the middle of the earth,\nand it was very tall.\nThe tree grew large and strong;\nits top reached to the sky, \nand it was visible to the ends of the   earth.\nIts leaves were beautiful, its fruit was abundant,\nand on it was food for all. \nWild animals found shelter under it,\nthe birds of the sky  lived in its branches,\nand every creature was fed from it. \n\n“As I was lying in my bed, I also saw in the visions of my mind a watcher, a holy one,  , coming down from heaven.  He called out loudly:\nCut down the tree and chop off its branches;\nstrip off its leaves and scatter its fruit.\nLet the animals flee from under it,\nand the birds from its branches. \nBut leave the stump with its roots in the ground \nand with a band of iron and bronze around it\nin the tender grass of the field.\nLet him be drenched with dew from the sky\nand share the plants of the earth \nwith the animals.\nLet his mind be changed from that of a human,\nand let him be given the mind of an animal\nfor seven periods of time.  , ,\nThis word is by decree of the watchers,\nand the decision is by command from the holy ones.\nThis is so that the living will know\nthat the Most High is ruler\nover human kingdoms.\nHe gives them to anyone he wants\nand sets the lowliest of people over them. \nThis is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now, Belteshazzar, tell me the interpretation, because none of the wise men of my kingdom can make the interpretation known to me.  But you can, because you have a spirit of the holy gods.”\n\nThen Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, was stunned for a moment, and his thoughts alarmed him. The king said, “Belteshazzar, don’t let the dream or its interpretation alarm you.”\nBelteshazzar answered, “My lord, may the dream apply to those who hate you, and its interpretation to your enemies!  The tree you saw, which grew large and strong, whose top reached to the sky and was visible to the whole earth, and whose leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant #— #and on it was food for all, under it the wild animals lived, and in its branches the birds of the sky lived #— # that tree is you, Your Majesty. For you have become great and strong: your greatness has grown and even reaches the sky, and your dominion extends to the ends of the earth. \n“The king saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, ‘Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump with its roots in the ground and with a band of iron and bronze around it in the tender grass of the field. Let him be drenched with dew from the sky and share food with the wild animals for seven periods of time.’ This is the interpretation, Your Majesty, and this is the decree of the Most High that has been issued against my lord the king:  You will be driven away from people to live with the wild animals. You will feed on grass like cattle  and be drenched with dew from the sky for seven periods of time, until you acknowledge that the Most High is ruler over human kingdoms, and he gives them to anyone he wants.  As for the command to leave the tree’s stump with its roots, your kingdom will be restored  to you as soon as you acknowledge that Heaven  rules.  Therefore, may my advice seem good to you my king. Separate yourself from your sins by doing what is right,  and from your injustices by showing mercy to the needy.  Perhaps there will be an extension of your prosperity.” \n\nAll this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.  At the end of twelve months, as he was walking on the roof of the royal palace in Babylon, the king exclaimed, “Is this not Babylon the Great that I have built to be a royal residence by my vast power and for my majestic glory? ” \nWhile the words were still in the king’s mouth, a voice came from heaven: “King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is declared that the kingdom has departed from you.  You will be driven away from people to live with the wild animals, and you will feed on grass like cattle for seven periods of time, until you acknowledge that the Most High is ruler over human kingdoms, and he gives them to anyone he wants.”\nAt that moment the message against Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from people. He ate grass like cattle, and his body was drenched with dew from the sky, until his hair grew like eagles’ feathers and his nails like birds’ claws. \n\nBut at the end of those days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to heaven, and my sanity returned to me. Then I praised the Most High and honored and glorified him who lives forever: \nFor his dominion is an everlasting dominion,\nand his kingdom is from generation to generation. \nAll the inhabitants of the earth are counted as nothing, \nand he does what he wants  with the army of heaven\nand the inhabitants of the earth.\nThere is no one who can block his hand\nor say to him, “What have you done? ” \nAt that time my sanity returned to me, and my majesty and splendor returned to me for the glory of my kingdom. My advisers and my nobles sought me out, I was reestablished over my kingdom, and even more greatness came to me.  Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, exalt, and glorify the King of the heavens, because all his works are true and his ways are just.  He is able to humble  those who walk in pride.",

      "chapter_text": "King Belshazzar  held a great feast for a thousand of his nobles and drank wine in their presence. Under the influence of  the wine, Belshazzar gave orders to bring in the gold and silver vessels  that his predecessor  Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king and his nobles, wives, and concubines could drink from them. So they brought in the gold  vessels that had been taken from the temple, the house of God in Jerusalem,  and the king and his nobles, wives, and concubines drank from them. They drank the wine and praised their gods made of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone. \n\nAt that moment the fingers of a man’s hand appeared and began writing on the plaster of the king’s palace wall next to the lampstand. As the king watched the hand  that was writing, his face turned pale,  and his thoughts so terrified him that he soiled himself  and his knees knocked together. The king shouted to bring in the mediums, Chaldeans, and diviners. He said to these wise men of Babylon, “Whoever reads this inscription and gives me its interpretation will be clothed in purple, have a gold chain around his neck,  and have the third highest position in the kingdom.” So all the king’s wise men came in, but none could read the inscription or make its interpretation known to him. Then King Belshazzar became even more terrified, his face turned pale,  and his nobles were bewildered. \nBecause of the outcry of the king and his nobles, the queen  came to the banquet hall. “May the king live forever,” she said. “Don’t let your thoughts terrify you or your face be pale.  , There is a man in your kingdom who has a spirit of the holy gods in him.  In the days of your predecessor he was found to have insight, intelligence, and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods. Your predecessor, King Nebuchadnezzar, appointed him chief of the magicians, mediums, Chaldeans, and diviners. Your own predecessor, the king, did this because Daniel, the one the king named Belteshazzar, was found to have an extraordinary spirit, knowledge and intelligence, and the ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve problems.  , Therefore, summon Daniel, and he will give the interpretation.”\n\nThen Daniel was brought before the king. The king said to him, “Are you Daniel, one of the Judean exiles that my predecessor the king brought from Judah?  I’ve heard that you have a spirit of the gods in you, and that insight, intelligence, and extraordinary wisdom are found in you. Now the wise men and mediums were brought before me to read this inscription and make its interpretation known to me, but they could not give its interpretation. However, I have heard about you that you can give interpretations and solve problems. Therefore, if you can read this inscription and give me its interpretation, you will be clothed in purple, have a gold chain around your neck, and have the third highest position in the kingdom.” \nThen Daniel answered the king, “You may keep your gifts and give your rewards to someone else;  however, I will read the inscription for the king and make the interpretation known to him. Your Majesty, the Most High God gave sovereignty,  greatness, glory, and majesty to your predecessor Nebuchadnezzar.  Because of the greatness he gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages  were terrified and fearful of him. He killed anyone he wanted and kept alive anyone he wanted; he exalted anyone he wanted and humbled anyone he wanted. But when his heart was exalted and his spirit became arrogant,  he was deposed from his royal throne and his glory was taken from him.  He was driven away from people,  his mind was like an animal’s, he lived with the wild donkeys,  he was fed grass like cattle, and his body was drenched with dew from the sky until he acknowledged that the Most High God is ruler over human kingdoms and sets anyone he wants over them. \n“But you his successor, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart,  even though you knew all this. Instead, you have exalted yourself against the Lord of the heavens. The vessels from his house were brought to you, and as you and your nobles, wives, and concubines drank wine from them,  you praised the gods made of silver and gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which do not see or hear or understand.  But you have not glorified the God who holds your life-breath in his hand and who controls the whole course of your life.  , Therefore, he sent the hand, and this writing was inscribed.\n\n“This is the writing that was inscribed: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, and PARSIN. This is the interpretation of the message:\n‘Mene’  means that God has numbered  the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end. \n‘Tekel’  means that you have been weighed  on the balance and found deficient.\n‘Peres’  , means that your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and Persians.” \n\nThen Belshazzar gave an order, and they clothed Daniel in purple, placed a gold chain around his neck,  and issued a proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.\nThat very night Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans was killed, and Darius the Mede  received the kingdom at the age of sixty-two.",

      "chapter_text": "Darius decided  to appoint 120 satraps over the kingdom, stationed throughout the realm, and over them three administrators, including Daniel.  These satraps would be accountable to them so that the king would not be defrauded.  Daniel  distinguished himself above the administrators and satraps because he had an extraordinary spirit,  so the king planned to set him over the whole realm.  The administrators and satraps, therefore, kept trying to find a charge against Daniel  regarding the kingdom. But they could find no charge or corruption,  for he was trustworthy, and no negligence or corruption was found in him. Then these men said, “We will never find any charge against this Daniel unless we find something against him concerning the law of his God.” \nSo the administrators and satraps went together to the king and said to him, “May King Darius live forever.  All the administrators of the kingdom   #— #the prefects, satraps, advisers, and governors #— #have agreed that the king should establish an ordinance and enforce an edict that, for thirty days, anyone who petitions any god or man except you, the king, will be thrown into the lions’ den.  Therefore, Your Majesty, establish the edict  and sign the document so that, as a law of the Medes and Persians, it is irrevocable and cannot be changed.”  So King Darius signed the written edict. \n\nWhen Daniel learned that the document had been signed, he went into his house. The windows in its upstairs room opened toward Jerusalem,  and three times a day he got down on his knees, prayed, and gave thanks to his God,  just as he had done before. Then these men went as a group and found  Daniel petitioning and imploring his God. So they approached the king  and asked about his edict: “Didn’t you sign an edict that for thirty days any person who petitions any god or man except you, the king, will be thrown into the lions’ den? ”\nThe king answered, “As a law of the Medes and Persians, the order stands  and is irrevocable.” \nThen they replied to the king, “Daniel, one of the Judean exiles, has ignored you,  the king, and the edict you signed, for he prays three times a day.” As soon as the king heard this, he was very displeased; he set his mind on rescuing Daniel  and made every effort until sundown to deliver him.\nThen these men went together to the king and said to him, “You know, Your Majesty, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no edict or ordinance the king establishes can be changed.” \nSo the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions’ den.  The king said to Daniel, “May your God, whom you continually serve,  rescue you! ” A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den.  The king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signet rings of his nobles, so that nothing in regard to Daniel could be changed. Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting.  No diversions  were brought to him, and he could not sleep. \n\nAt the first light of dawn the king got up and hurried to the lions’ den. When he reached the den, he cried out in anguish to Daniel. “Daniel, servant of the living God,” the king said,  “has your God, whom you continually serve, been able to rescue you  from the lions? ”\nThen Daniel spoke with the king: “May the king live forever. My God sent his angel  and shut the lions’ mouths; and they haven’t harmed me, for I was found innocent before him. And also before you, Your Majesty, I have not done harm.”\nThe king was overjoyed and gave orders to take Daniel out of the den. When Daniel was brought up from the den, he was found to be unharmed, for he trusted in his God.  The king then gave the command, and those men who had maliciously accused Daniel  , were brought and thrown into the lions’ den #— #they, their children, and their wives.  They had not reached the bottom of the den before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.\n\nThen King Darius wrote to those of every people, nation, and language who live on the whole earth: “May your prosperity abound.  I issue a decree  that in all my royal dominion, people must tremble in fear before the God of Daniel: \nFor he is the living God,\nand he endures forever;\nhis kingdom will never be destroyed, \nand his dominion has no end.\nHe rescues and delivers;\nhe performs signs and wonders\nin the heavens and on the earth, \nfor he has rescued Daniel\nfrom the power of the lions.”\n\nSo Daniel prospered  during the reign of Darius and  the reign of Cyrus the Persian.",

He wrote down the dream,  and here is the summary  of his account. Daniel said, “In my vision at night I was watching, and suddenly the four winds of heaven  stirred up the great sea. Four huge beasts  came up from the sea,  each different from the other.\n“The first was like a lion  but had eagle’s wings. I continued watching until its wings were torn off. It was lifted up from the ground, set on its feet like a man, and given a human mind.\n“Suddenly, another beast appeared, a second one, that looked like a bear.  It was raised up on one side, with three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, ‘Get up! Gorge yourself on flesh.’\n“After this, while I was watching, suddenly another beast appeared. It was like a leopard  with four wings of a bird on its back. It had four heads,  and it was given dominion.\n“After this, while I was watching in the night visions, suddenly a fourth beast  appeared, frightening and dreadful, and incredibly strong, with large iron teeth. It devoured and crushed, and it trampled with its feet whatever was left. It was different from all the beasts before it, and it had ten horns. \n“While I was considering the horns, suddenly another horn,  a little one, came up among them, and three of the first horns were uprooted before it. And suddenly in this horn there were eyes like the eyes of a human and a mouth that was speaking arrogantly. \n\n“As I kept watching,\nthrones were set in place, \nand the Ancient of Days took his seat.\nHis clothing was white like snow, \nand the hair of his head like whitest wool. \nHis throne was flaming fire; \nits wheels were blazing fire. \nA river of fire was flowing,\ncoming out from his presence.\nThousands upon thousands  served him;\nten thousand times ten thousand  stood before him.\nThe court was convened, \nand the books were opened. \n\n“I watched, then, because of the sound of the arrogant words the horn was speaking. As I continued watching, the beast was killed and its body destroyed and given over to the burning fire.  As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was removed, but an extension of life was granted to them for a certain period of time.  I continued watching in the night visions,\nand suddenly one like a son of man \nwas coming with the clouds of heaven. \nHe approached the Ancient of Days\nand was escorted before him.\nHe was given dominion \nand glory and a kingdom,\nso that those of every people,\nnation, and language \nshould serve  him.\nHis dominion is an everlasting   dominion\nthat will not pass away,\nand his kingdom is one\nthat will not be destroyed.\n\n“As for me, Daniel, my spirit was deeply distressed within me,  and the visions in my mind terrified me.  I approached one of those who were standing by and asked him  to clarify all this. So he let me know the interpretation of these things:  ‘These huge beasts, four in number, are four kings who will rise from the earth. But the holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom and possess it forever, yes, forever and ever.’ \n“Then I wanted to be clear about the fourth beast,  the one different from all the others, extremely terrifying, with iron teeth and bronze claws, devouring, crushing, and trampling with its feet whatever was left. I also wanted to know about the ten horns  on its head and about the other horn that came up, before which three fell #— #the horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke arrogantly,  and that looked bigger than the others. As I was watching, this horn waged war  against the holy ones and was prevailing over them until the Ancient of Days arrived and a judgment  was given in favor of the holy ones of the Most High, for the time had come, and the holy ones took possession of the kingdom.\n“This is what he said: ‘The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on the earth, different from all the other kingdoms. It will devour the whole earth, trample it down, and crush it. The ten horns  are ten kings who will rise from this kingdom. Another king, different from the previous ones, will rise after them and subdue three kings. He will speak words against the Most High  and oppress  the holy ones  of the Most High. He will intend to change religious festivals  and laws,  and the holy ones will be handed over to him for a time, times, and half a time.  , But the court will convene,  and his dominion will be taken away, to be completely destroyed forever.  The kingdom, dominion, and greatness of the kingdoms under all of heaven will be given to the people, the holy ones of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom,  and all rulers will serve and obey him.’\n“This is the end of the account. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts terrified me greatly,  and my face turned pale,  but I kept the matter to myself.”",

      "chapter_text": "In the third year of King Belshazzar’s  reign, a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after the one that had appeared to me earlier.  I saw the vision, and as I watched, I was in the fortress city of Susa,  in the province of Elam.  I saw in the vision that I was beside the Ulai Canal. I looked up,  and there was a ram  standing beside the canal. He had two horns. The two horns were long, but one was longer than the other, and the longer one came up last. I saw the ram charging to the west, the north, and the south.  No animal could stand against him, and there was no rescue from his power. He did whatever he wanted  and became great.\nAs I was observing, a male goat appeared, coming from the west across the surface of the entire earth without touching the ground. The goat had a conspicuous horn  between his eyes.  He came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and rushed at him with savage fury. I saw him approaching the ram and, infuriated with him, he struck the ram, breaking his two horns, and the ram was not strong enough to stand against him. The goat threw him to the ground and trampled him, and there was no one to rescue the ram from his power. Then the male goat acted even more arrogantly,  but when he became powerful, the large horn was broken.  Four conspicuous horns came up in its place, pointing toward the four winds of heaven. \n\nFrom one of them a little horn  emerged and grew extensively toward the south and the east and toward the beautiful land.  , It grew as high as the heavenly army, made some of the army and some of the stars  fall to the earth,  and trampled them.  It acted arrogantly  even against the Prince of the heavenly army;  it revoked his regular sacrifice  and overthrew the place of his sanctuary. In the rebellion, the army was given up, together with the regular sacrifice. The horn threw truth to the ground and was successful  in what it did.\nThen I heard a holy one speaking,  and another holy one said to the speaker, “How long will the events of this vision last   #— #the regular sacrifice, the rebellion that makes desolate, and the giving over of the sanctuary and of the army to be trampled? ” \nHe said to me,  “For 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be restored.”\n\nWhile I, Daniel, was watching the vision and trying to understand it, there stood before me someone who appeared to be a man.  I heard a human voice calling from the middle of the Ulai: “Gabriel,  explain the vision to this man.”\nSo he approached where I was standing; when he came near, I was terrified and fell facedown.  “Son of man,” he said to me, “understand that the vision refers to the time of the end.”  While he was speaking to me, I fell into a deep sleep,  with my face to the ground. Then he touched me, made me stand up,  and said, “I am here to tell you what will happen at the conclusion of the time of wrath, because it refers to the appointed time of the end.  The two-horned ram  that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia. The shaggy goat represents the king of Greece, and the large horn between his eyes represents the first king.  The four horns that took the place of the broken horn represent four kingdoms. They will rise from that nation, but without its power.\nNear the end of their kingdoms,\nwhen the rebels have reached\nthe full measure of their sin,  ,\na ruthless  king, skilled in intrigue, \nwill come to the throne.\nHis power will be great,\nbut it will not be his own.\nHe will cause outrageous destruction \nand succeed in whatever he does.\nHe will destroy the powerful\nalong with the holy people. \nHe will cause deceit to prosper\nthrough his cunning and by his influence,\nand in his own mind he will exalt himself.\nHe will destroy many in a time of peace;\nhe will even stand against the Prince of princes.\nYet he will be broken #— #not by human hands. \nThe vision of the evenings and the mornings\nthat has been told is true.\nNow you are to seal up the vision \nbecause it refers to many days in the future.”\n\nI, Daniel, was overcome and lay sick for days.  Then I got up and went about the king’s business.  I was greatly disturbed by the vision and could not understand it.",

LORD, public shame  belongs to us, our kings, our leaders, and our ancestors, because we have sinned against you.  Compassion and forgiveness belong to the Lord our God, though we have rebelled against him and have not obeyed the LORD our God by following his instructions that he set before us through his servants  the prophets.\n\nAll Israel has broken your law and turned away,  refusing to obey you. The promised curse  written in the law of Moses,  the servant of God, has been poured out on us because we have sinned against him. He has carried out his words  that he spoke against us and against our rulers  , by bringing on us a disaster that is so great that nothing like what has been done to Jerusalem has ever been done  under all of heaven. Just as it is written in the law of Moses,  all this disaster has come on us, yet we have not sought the favor of  the LORD our God by turning from our iniquities and paying attention to your truth.  So the LORD kept the disaster in mind and brought it on us, for the LORD our God is righteous in all he has done. But we have not obeyed him.\n\nNow, Lord our God #— #who brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand  and made your name renowned  as it is this day #— #we have sinned, we have acted wickedly. Lord, in keeping with all your righteous acts, may your anger and wrath  turn away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain;  for because of our sins and the iniquities of our ancestors, Jerusalem and your people have become an object of ridicule to all those around us.\n\nTherefore, our God, hear the prayer and the petitions of your servant. Make your face shine  on your desolate sanctuary  for the Lord’s sake. Listen closely,  my God, and hear. Open your eyes and see our desolations and the city that bears your name. For we are not presenting our petitions before you based on our righteous acts, but based on your abundant compassion. Lord, hear! Lord, forgive! Lord, listen and act! My God, for your own sake, do not delay,  because your city and your people bear your name.\n\nWhile I was speaking, praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel,  and presenting my petition before the LORD my God concerning the holy mountain of my God #— # while I was praying, Gabriel,  the man I had seen in the first vision,  reached me in my extreme weariness, about the time of the evening offering.  He gave me this explanation: “Daniel, I’ve come now to give you understanding.  At the beginning of your petitions an answer went out, and I have come to give it, for you are treasured by God.  , So consider the message and understand the vision: \nSeventy weeks are decreed \nabout your people and your holy city —\nto bring the rebellion to an end,\nto put a stop to sin,\nto atone for iniquity,\nto bring in everlasting righteousness, \nto seal up vision and prophecy,\nand to anoint the most holy place.\nKnow and understand this:\nFrom the issuing of the decree\nto restore and rebuild Jerusalem \nuntil an Anointed One,  the ruler, \nwill be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks.\nIt will be rebuilt with a plaza and a moat,\nbut in difficult times.\nAfter those sixty-two weeks\nthe Anointed One will be cut off \nand will have nothing.\nThe people of the coming ruler\nwill destroy the city  and the sanctuary. \nThe  end will come with a flood, \nand until the end there will be   war;\ndesolations are decreed.\nHe will make a firm covenant \nwith many for one week,\nbut in the middle of the week\nhe will put a stop to sacrifice and offering.\nAnd the abomination of desolation \nwill be on a wing  of the temple  ,\nuntil the decreed destruction \nis poured out on the desolator.”",

He understood the message and had understanding of the vision. \nIn those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three full weeks.  I didn’t eat any rich food,  no meat or wine entered my mouth, and I didn’t put any oil on my body until the three weeks were over. On the twenty-fourth day of the first month,  as I was standing on the bank of the great river,  the Tigris, I looked up, and there was a man dressed in linen,  with a belt of gold  from Uphaz  , around his waist. His body was like beryl,  his face like the brilliance of lightning, his eyes like flaming torches,  his arms and feet like the gleam of polished bronze, and the sound of his words like the sound of a multitude. \nOnly I, Daniel, saw the vision.  The men who were with me did not see it,  but a great terror fell on them,  and they ran and hid. I was left alone, looking at this great vision.  No strength was left in me; my face grew deathly pale,  , and I was powerless. I heard the words he said, and when I heard them I fell into a deep sleep,  , with my face to the ground.\n\nSuddenly, a hand touched me and set me shaking on my hands and knees. He said to me, “Daniel, you are a man treasured by God.  , Understand the words that I’m saying to you. Stand on your feet,  for I have now been sent to you.”  After he said this to me, I stood trembling.\n“Don’t be afraid,  Daniel,” he said to me, “for from the first day that you purposed to understand and to humble yourself before your God,  your prayers were heard. I have come because of your prayers.  But the prince of the kingdom of Persia opposed me for twenty-one days. Then Michael,  one of the chief princes, came to help me after I had been left there with the kings of Persia.  Now I have come to help you understand what will happen to your people in the last days,  for the vision refers to those days.” \nWhile he was saying these words to me, I turned my face toward the ground and was speechless.  Suddenly one with human likeness  touched my lips.  I opened my mouth and said to the one standing in front of me, “My lord, because of the vision, anguish overwhelms me and I am powerless.  How can someone like me,  your servant,  speak with someone like you, my lord? Now I have no strength, and there is no breath in me.”\nThen the one with a human appearance touched me again and strengthened me.  He said, “Don’t be afraid,  you who are  treasured by God.  Peace to you; be very strong! ” \nAs he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, “Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.” \nHe said, “Do you know why I’ve come to you? I must return at once to fight against the prince of Persia, and when I leave, the prince of Greece will come.  However, I will tell you what is recorded in the book of truth. (No one has the courage to support me against those princes except Michael,  your prince.",

      "chapter_text": "In the first year of Darius the Mede,  I stood up to strengthen and protect him.) Now I will tell you the truth. \n\n“Three more kings will arise in Persia, and the fourth will be far richer than the others. By the power he gains through his riches, he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece.  Then a warrior king will arise; he will rule a vast realm and do whatever he wants.  But as soon as he is established, his kingdom will be broken up and divided to the four winds of heaven,  but not to his descendants; it will not be the same kingdom that he ruled, because his kingdom will be uprooted and will go to others besides them. \n\n“The king of the South  will grow powerful, but one of his commanders will grow more powerful and will rule a kingdom greater than his. After some years they will form an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the South will go to the king of the North  to seal the agreement. She will not retain power, and his strength will not endure. She will be given up, together with her entourage, her father,  and the one who supported her during those times. In the place of the king of the South, one from her family  will rise up, come against the army, and enter the fortress of the king of the North. He will take action against them and triumph. He will take even their gods captive to Egypt, with their metal images and their precious articles of silver and gold.  For some years he will stay away from the king of the North, who will enter the kingdom of the king of the South and then return to his own land.\n“His sons will mobilize for war and assemble a large number of armed forces. They will advance, sweeping through like a flood,  , and will again wage war as far as his fortress. Infuriated, the king of the South will march out to fight with the king of the North, who will raise a large army, but they will be handed over to his enemy. When the army is carried off, he will become arrogant and cause tens of thousands to fall, but he will not triumph. The king of the North will again raise a multitude larger than the first. After some years  , he will advance with a great army and many supplies.\n“In those times many will rise up against the king of the South. Violent ones among your own people will assert themselves to fulfill a vision, but they will fail. Then the king of the North will come, build up a siege ramp,  and capture a well-fortified city. The forces of the South will not stand; even their select troops will not be able to resist. The king of the North who comes against him will do whatever he wants,  and no one can oppose him. He will establish himself in the beautiful land  , with total destruction in his hand. He will resolve  to come with the force of his whole kingdom and will reach an agreement with him.  He will give him a daughter in marriage  to destroy it,  but she will not stand with him or support him. Then he will turn his attention to the coasts and islands  , and capture many. But a commander will put an end to his taunting; instead, he will turn his taunts against him.  He will turn his attention back to the fortresses of his own land, but he will stumble, fall,  and be no more. \n“In his place one will arise who will send out a tax collector  for the glory of the kingdom; but within a few days he will be broken, though not in anger  or in battle.\n“In his place a despised  person will arise; royal honors will not be given to him, but he will come during a time of peace  , and seize the kingdom by intrigue. A flood of forces will be swept away before him; they will be broken, as well as the covenant prince. After an alliance is made with him, he will act deceitfully. He will rise to power with a small nation.  During a time of peace,  he will come into the richest parts of the province  and do what his fathers and predecessors never did. He will lavish plunder, loot, and wealth on his followers, and he will make plans against fortified cities, but only for a time.\n“With a large army he will stir up his power and his courage against the king of the South. The king of the South will prepare for battle with an extremely large and powerful army, but he will not succeed, because plots will be made against him. Those who eat his provisions  will destroy him; his army will be swept away, and many will fall slain. The two kings, whose hearts are bent on evil, will speak lies  at the same table but to no avail, for still the end will come at the appointed time.  The king of the North will return to his land with great wealth, but his heart will be set against the holy covenant;  he will take action, then return to his own land.\n“At the appointed time he will come again to the South, but this time  will not be like the first. Ships of Kittim  , will come against him, and being intimidated, he will withdraw. Then he will rage against the holy covenant and take action. On his return, he will favor those who abandon the holy covenant. His forces will rise up and desecrate the temple fortress. They will abolish the regular sacrifice  and set up the abomination of desolation.  With flattery he will corrupt those who act wickedly toward the covenant, but the people who know their God will be strong and take action.  Those who have insight among the people  will give understanding to many, yet they will fall by the sword and flame,  and they will be captured and plundered for a time. When they fall, they will be helped by some, but many others will join them insincerely.  Some of those who have insight will fall so that they may be refined,  purified, and cleansed  until the time of the end, for it will still come at the appointed time.\n“Then the king will do whatever he wants.  He will exalt and magnify himself above every god,  and he will say outrageous things against the God of gods.  He will be successful until the time of wrath is completed,  because what has been decreed will be accomplished. He will not show regard for the gods  of his ancestors, the god desired by women, or for any other god,  because he will magnify himself above all. Instead, he will honor a god of fortresses #— #a god his ancestors did not know #— #with gold, silver, precious stones, and riches. He will deal with the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god. He will greatly honor those who acknowledge him,  making them rulers over many and distributing land as a reward.\n“At the time of the end, the king of the South will engage him in battle, but the king of the North will storm against him  with chariots, horsemen, and many ships. He will invade countries and sweep through them like a flood.  He will also invade the beautiful land,  and many will fall. But these will escape from his power: Edom, Moab, and the prominent people  of the Ammonites.  He will extend his power against the countries, and not even the land of Egypt will escape. He will get control over the hidden treasures of gold and silver and over all the riches of Egypt. The Libyans and Cushites will also be in submission.  , But reports from the east  and the north will terrify him, and he will go out with great fury to annihilate and completely destroy many. He will pitch his royal tents between the sea and  the beautiful holy mountain,  but he will meet his end with no one to help him.",

One of them said to the man dressed in linen,  who was above the water of the river,  “How long until the end  of these wondrous things? ” Then I heard the man dressed in linen, who was above the water of the river. He raised both his hands  , toward heaven and swore by him who lives eternally  that it would be for a time, times, and half a time.  When the power of the holy people is shattered, all these things will be completed.\nI heard but did not understand. So I asked, “My lord, what will be the outcome of these things? ” \nHe said, “Go on your way, Daniel, for the words are secret  and sealed until the time of the end.  Many will be purified,  cleansed, and refined,  but the wicked will act wickedly;  none of the wicked will understand, but those who have insight will understand.  From the time the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination of desolation  is set up,  there will be 1,290 days. Happy is the one who waits  for and reaches 1,335 days. But as for you, go on your way to the end;  you will rest, and then you will rise  to receive  your allotted inheritance at the end of the days.”",
