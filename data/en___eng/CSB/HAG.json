Go up into the hills, bring down lumber, and build the house; and I will be pleased with it and be glorified,” says the LORD. “You expected much, but then it amounted to little. When you brought the harvest to your house, I ruined  it. Why? ” This is the declaration of the LORD of Armies. “Because my house still lies in ruins, while each of you is busy with his own house.\nSo on your account, \nthe skies have withheld the dew\nand the land its crops. \nI have summoned a drought\non the fields and the hills,\non the grain, new wine, fresh oil,\nand whatever the ground yields,\non people and animals,\nand on all that your hands produce.”\n\nThen Zerubbabel  son of Shealtiel, the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak, and the entire remnant of the people  obeyed the LORD their God and the words of the prophet Haggai, because the LORD their God had sent him. So the people feared the LORD. \nThen Haggai, the LORD’s messenger, delivered the LORD’s message to the people: “I am with you   #— #this is the LORD’s declaration.”\nThe LORD roused the spirit  of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, the spirit of the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people. They began work on the house of the LORD of Armies, their God, on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of King Darius.",

      "chapter_text": "On the twenty-first day of the seventh month,  the word of the LORD came through the prophet Haggai: “Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, to the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak, and to the remnant of the people: ‘Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Doesn’t it seem to you like nothing by comparison?  Even so, be strong, Zerubbabel #— #this is the LORD’s declaration.  Be strong, Joshua son of Jehozadak, high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land #— #this is the LORD’s declaration. Work! For I am with you   #— #the declaration of the LORD of Armies. This is the promise I made to you when you came out of Egypt,  and my Spirit is present among you; don’t be afraid.’ ”\nFor the LORD of Armies says this: “Once more, in a little while, I am going to shake the heavens and the earth,  the sea and the dry land.  I will shake all the nations so that the treasures of all the nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory,”  says the LORD of Armies. “The silver and gold belong to me” #— #this is the declaration of the LORD of Armies. “The final glory of this house  will be greater than the first,”  says the LORD of Armies. “I will provide peace in this place”   #— #this is the declaration of the LORD of Armies.\n\nOn the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Haggai: “This is what the LORD of Armies says: Ask the priests for a ruling.  If a man is carrying consecrated meat in the fold of his garment, and it touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any other food, does it become holy? ” \nThe priests answered, “No.”\nThen Haggai asked, “If someone defiled by contact with a corpse touches any of these, does it become defiled? ” \nThe priests answered, “It becomes defiled.”\nThen Haggai replied, “So is this people, and so is this nation before me #— #this is the LORD’s declaration. And so is every work of their hands; even what they offer there is defiled.\n“Now from this day on, think carefully: Before one stone was placed on another in the LORD’s temple, what state were you in?  When someone came to a grain heap of twenty measures, it only amounted to ten; when one came to the winepress to dip fifty measures from the vat, it only amounted to twenty. I struck you #— #all the work of your hands #— #with blight, mildew,  and hail,  but you didn’t turn to me #— #this is the LORD’s declaration. From this day on, think carefully;  from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, from the day the foundation of the LORD’s temple was laid; think carefully. Is there still seed left in the granary? The vine, the fig, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not yet produced. But from this day on I will bless you.” \n\nThe word of the LORD came to Haggai a second time on the twenty-fourth day of the month: “Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah: I am going to shake the heavens and the earth.  I will overturn royal thrones and destroy the power of the Gentile kingdoms.  I will overturn chariots and their riders. Horses and their riders will fall, each by his brother’s sword. On that day” #— #this is the declaration of the LORD of Armies #— #“I will take you, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, my servant” #— #this is the LORD’s declaration #— #“and make you like my signet ring,  for I have chosen you.”  This is the declaration of the LORD of Armies.",
