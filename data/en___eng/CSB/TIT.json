An elder  must be blameless,  the husband of one wife, with faithful  children who are not accused of wildness or rebellion. As an overseer  of God’s household, he must be blameless, not arrogant, not hot-tempered, not an excessive drinker, not a bully, not greedy for money, but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, righteous, holy, self-controlled, holding to the faithful message as taught,  so that he will be able both to encourage with sound teaching  and to refute those who contradict it.\nFor there are many rebellious people, full of empty talk and deception, especially those from the circumcision party. It is necessary to silence them; they are ruining entire households by teaching what they shouldn’t in order to get money dishonestly. One of their very own prophets said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.” This testimony is true.  For this reason, rebuke them sharply,  so that they may be sound in the faith and may not pay attention to Jewish myths  and the commands of people who reject the truth. \nTo the pure, everything is pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; in fact, both their mind and conscience  are defiled. They claim to know God,  but they deny him by their works.  They are detestable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.",

For we too were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved by various passions  and pleasures,  living in malice and envy, hateful, detesting one another.\nBut when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared,  he saved us   #— #not by works of righteousness that we had done,  but according to his mercy   #— #through the washing of regeneration  and renewal by the Holy Spirit.  He poured out his Spirit on us abundantly  through Jesus Christ our Savior so that, having been justified by his grace,  we may become heirs with the hope of eternal life.  This saying is trustworthy.  I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed God might be careful to devote themselves to good works. These are good and profitable for everyone. But avoid foolish debates,  genealogies,  quarrels,  and disputes about the law, because they are unprofitable and worthless. Reject a divisive  person after a first and second warning.  For you know that such a person has gone astray and is sinning; he is self-condemned.\n\nWhen I send Artemas or Tychicus to you,  make every effort to come to me  in Nicopolis, because I have decided to spend the winter there. Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos  on their journey, so that they will lack  nothing.\nLet our people learn to devote themselves to good works for pressing needs, so that they will not be unfruitful.  All those who are with me send you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with all of you.",
