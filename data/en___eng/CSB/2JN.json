So now I ask you, dear lady #— #not as if I were writing you a new command, but one we have had from the beginning #— #that we love one another.  This is love:  that we walk according to his commands.  This is the command as you have heard it from the beginning: that you walk in love. \nMany deceivers have gone out into the world; they do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh.  This is the deceiver and the antichrist.  Watch yourselves so that you don’t lose what we  have worked for, but that you may receive a full reward.  Anyone who does not remain in Christ’s teaching  but goes beyond it does not have God.  The one who remains  in that teaching, this one has both the Father  and the Son.  If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive  him into your home, and do not greet him; for the one who greets him shares  in his evil works. \n\nThough I have many things to write to you,  I don’t want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to come to you and talk face to face so that our joy  may be complete.\nThe children of your elect sister send you greetings.",
