Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention. Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.\nBehold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for I will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be told you. For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not their's. They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves. Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat.\nThey shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand. And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it. Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, imputing this his power unto his god.\nArt thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction. Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he? And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?\nThey take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad. Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous. Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?",

For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry. Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.\nYea also, because he transgresseth by wine, he is a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people: shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay! Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them? Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.\nWoe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil! Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned against thy soul. For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.\nWoe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity! Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity? For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.\nWoe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness! Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD's right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing shall be on thy glory. For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, which made them afraid, because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.\nWhat profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols? Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it. But the LORD is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.",

Selah.\nHis glory covered the heavens,\nAnd the earth was full of his praise.\nAnd his brightness was as the light;\nHe had horns coming out of his hand:\nAnd there was the hiding of his power.\nBefore him went the pestilence,\nAnd burning coals went forth at his feet.\nHe stood, and measured the earth:\nHe beheld, and drove asunder the nations;\nAnd the everlasting mountains were scattered,\nThe perpetual hills did bow:\nHis ways are everlasting.\nI saw the tents of Cushan in affliction:\nAnd the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.\nWas the LORD displeased against the rivers?\nWas thine anger against the rivers?\nWas thy wrath against the sea,\nThat thou didst ride upon thine horses\nAnd thy chariots of salvation?\nThy bow was made quite naked,\nAccording to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word. Selah.\nThou didst cleave the earth with rivers.\nThe mountains saw thee, and they trembled:\nThe overflowing of the water passed by:\nThe deep uttered his voice,\nAnd lifted up his hands on high.\nThe sun and moon stood still in their habitation:\nAt the light of thine arrows they went,\nAnd at the shining of thy glittering spear.\nThou didst march through the land in indignation,\nThou didst thresh the heathen in anger.\nThou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people,\nEven for salvation with thine anointed;\nThou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked,\nBy discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.\nThou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages:\nThey came out as a whirlwind to scatter me:\nTheir rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.\nThou didst walk through the sea with thine horses,\nThrough the heap of great waters.\n\nWhen I heard, my belly trembled;\nMy lips quivered at the voice:\nRottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself,\nThat I might rest in the day of trouble:\nWhen he cometh up unto the people,\nHe will invade them with his troops.\nAlthough the fig tree shall not blossom,\nNeither shall fruit be in the vines;\nThe labour of the olive shall fail,\nAnd the fields shall yield no meat;\nThe flock shall be cut off from the fold,\nAnd there shall be no herd in the stalls:\nYet I will rejoice in the LORD,\nI will joy in the God of my salvation.\nThe LORD God is my strength,\nAnd he will make my feet like hinds' feet,\nAnd he will make me to walk upon mine high places.\nTo the chief singer on my stringed instruments.",
