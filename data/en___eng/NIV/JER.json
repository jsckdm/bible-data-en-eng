The book mixes sermons, prophetic oracles, and biographical narratives of Jeremiah’s experiences during the last years of the Judean kingdom. We are given an intimate look into the prophet’s own heart as he brings God’s message to his fellow Judeans, who reject him and even conspire to kill him.\nThe book begins and ends with historical references to the event Jeremiah was best known for predicting: the fall of Jerusalem. The four main parts generally consist (in order) of oracles, narratives (two sections), and then oracles. Significantly, each of these four parts ends with a reference to Jeremiah’s words being written in a book or scroll. A long poetic oracle is inserted in the middle narrative of the book. So Jeremiah’s prophecies appear at the beginning, middle and end of the book, highlighting their importance. The middle oracle, promising a new covenant designed to change the human heart, is shown to be the most important of all. God will do more than simply punish evil—he will overcome it with good.\nThe book of Jeremiah carries us back and forth in place and time as we turn its pages, yet its themes are consistent. The message of judgment for wrongdoing is followed by the restorative power of forgiveness and new life: to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant.",

loved me\nand followed me through the wilderness,\nthrough a land not sown.\nIsrael was holy to the LORD,\nthe firstfruits of his harvest;\nall who devoured her were held guilty,\nand disaster overtook them,’ ”\ndeclares the LORD.\n\nHear the word of the LORD, you descendants of Jacob,\nall you clans of Israel.\nThis is what the LORD says:\n“What fault did your ancestors find in me,\nthat they strayed so far from me?\nThey followed worthless idols\nand became worthless themselves.\nThey did not ask, ‘Where is the LORD,\nwho brought us up out of Egypt\nand led us through the barren wilderness,\nthrough a land of deserts and ravines,\na land of drought and utter darkness,\na land where no one travels and no one lives?’\nI brought you into a fertile land\nto eat its fruit and rich produce.\nBut you came and defiled my land\nand made my inheritance detestable.\nThe priests did not ask,\n‘Where is the LORD?’\nThose who deal with the law did not know me;\nthe leaders rebelled against me.\nThe prophets prophesied by Baal,\nfollowing worthless idols.\n\n“Therefore I bring charges against you again,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“And I will bring charges against your children’s children.\nCross over to the coasts of Cyprus and look,\nsend to Kedar and observe closely;\nsee if there has ever been anything like this:\nHas a nation ever changed its gods?\n(Yet they are not gods at all.)\nBut my people have exchanged their glorious God\nfor worthless idols.\nBe appalled at this, you heavens,\nand shudder with great horror,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“My people have committed two sins:\nThey have forsaken me,\nthe spring of living water,\nand have dug their own cisterns,\nbroken cisterns that cannot hold water.\nIs Israel a servant, a slave by birth?\nWhy then has he become plunder?\nLions have roared;\nthey have growled at him.\nThey have laid waste his land;\nhis towns are burned and deserted.\nAlso, the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes\nhave cracked your skull.\nHave you not brought this on yourselves\nby forsaking the LORD your God\nwhen he led you in the way?\nNow why go to Egypt\nto drink water from the Nile?\nAnd why go to Assyria\nto drink water from the Euphrates?\nYour wickedness will punish you;\nyour backsliding will rebuke you.\nConsider then and realize\nhow evil and bitter it is for you\nwhen you forsake the LORD your God\nand have no awe of me,”\ndeclares the Lord, the LORD Almighty.\n\n“Long ago you broke off your yoke\nand tore off your bonds;\nyou said, ‘I will not serve you!’\nIndeed, on every high hill\nand under every spreading tree\nyou lay down as a prostitute.\nI had planted you like a choice vine\nof sound and reliable stock.\nHow then did you turn against me\ninto a corrupt, wild vine?\nAlthough you wash yourself with soap\nand use an abundance of cleansing powder,\nthe stain of your guilt is still before me,”\ndeclares the Sovereign LORD.\n“How can you say, ‘I am not defiled;\nI have not run after the Baals’?\nSee how you behaved in the valley;\nconsider what you have done.\nYou are a swift she-camel\nrunning here and there,\na wild donkey accustomed to the desert,\nsniffing the wind in her craving—\nin her heat who can restrain her?\nAny males that pursue her need not tire themselves;\nat mating time they will find her.\nDo not run until your feet are bare\nand your throat is dry.\nBut you said, ‘It’s no use!\nI love foreign gods,\nand I must go after them.’\n\n“As a thief is disgraced when he is caught,\nso the people of Israel are disgraced—\nthey, their kings and their officials,\ntheir priests and their prophets.\nThey say to wood, ‘You are my father,’\nand to stone, ‘You gave me birth.’\nThey have turned their backs to me\nand not their faces;\nyet when they are in trouble, they say,\n‘Come and save us!’\nWhere then are the gods you made for yourselves?\nLet them come if they can save you\nwhen you are in trouble!\nFor you, Judah, have as many gods\nas you have towns.\n\n“Why do you bring charges against me?\nYou have all rebelled against me,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“In vain I punished your people;\nthey did not respond to correction.\nYour sword has devoured your prophets\nlike a ravenous lion.\n“You of this generation, consider the word of the LORD:\n“Have I been a desert to Israel\nor a land of great darkness?\nWhy do my people say, ‘We are free to roam;\nwe will come to you no more’?\nDoes a young woman forget her jewelry,\na bride her wedding ornaments?\nYet my people have forgotten me,\ndays without number.\nHow skilled you are at pursuing love!\nEven the worst of women can learn from your ways.\nOn your clothes is found\nthe lifeblood of the innocent poor,\nthough you did not catch them breaking in.\nYet in spite of all this\nyou say, ‘I am innocent;\nhe is not angry with me.’\nBut I will pass judgment on you\nbecause you say, ‘I have not sinned.’\nWhy do you go about so much,\nchanging your ways?\nYou will be disappointed by Egypt\nas you were by Assyria.\nYou will also leave that place\nwith your hands on your head,\nfor the LORD has rejected those you trust;\nyou will not be helped by them.",

She has gone up on every high hill and under every spreading tree and has committed adultery there. I thought that after she had done all this she would return to me but she did not, and her unfaithful sister Judah saw it. I gave faithless Israel her certificate of divorce and sent her away because of all her adulteries. Yet I saw that her unfaithful sister Judah had no fear; she also went out and committed adultery. Because Israel’s immorality mattered so little to her, she defiled the land and committed adultery with stone and wood. In spite of all this, her unfaithful sister Judah did not return to me with all her heart, but only in pretense,” declares the LORD.\nThe LORD said to me, “Faithless Israel is more righteous than unfaithful Judah. Go, proclaim this message toward the north:\n“ ‘Return, faithless Israel,’ declares the LORD,\n‘I will frown on you no longer,\nfor I am faithful,’ declares the LORD,\n‘I will not be angry forever.\nOnly acknowledge your guilt—\nyou have rebelled against the LORD your God,\nyou have scattered your favors to foreign gods\nunder every spreading tree,\nand have not obeyed me,’ ”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“Return, faithless people,” declares the LORD, “for I am your husband. I will choose you—one from a town and two from a clan—and bring you to Zion. Then I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will lead you with knowledge and understanding. In those days, when your numbers have increased greatly in the land,” declares the LORD, “people will no longer say, ‘The ark of the covenant of the LORD.’ It will never enter their minds or be remembered; it will not be missed, nor will another one be made. At that time they will call Jerusalem The Throne of the LORD, and all nations will gather in Jerusalem to honor the name of the LORD. No longer will they follow the stubbornness of their evil hearts. In those days the people of Judah will join the people of Israel, and together they will come from a northern land to the land I gave your ancestors as an inheritance.\n“I myself said,\n“ ‘How gladly would I treat you like my children\nand give you a pleasant land,\nthe most beautiful inheritance of any nation.’\nI thought you would call me ‘Father’\nand not turn away from following me.\nBut like a woman unfaithful to her husband,\nso you, Israel, have been unfaithful to me,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n\nA cry is heard on the barren heights,\nthe weeping and pleading of the people of Israel,\nbecause they have perverted their ways\nand have forgotten the LORD their God.\n\n“Return, faithless people;\nI will cure you of backsliding.”\n\n“Yes, we will come to you,\nfor you are the LORD our God.\nSurely the idolatrous commotion on the hills\nand mountains is a deception;\nsurely in the LORD our God\nis the salvation of Israel.\nFrom our youth shameful gods have consumed\nthe fruits of our ancestors’ labor—\ntheir flocks and herds,\ntheir sons and daughters.\nLet us lie down in our shame,\nand let our disgrace cover us.\nWe have sinned against the LORD our God,\nboth we and our ancestors;\nfrom our youth till this day\nwe have not obeyed the LORD our God.”",

How completely you have deceived this people and Jerusalem by saying, ‘You will have peace,’ when the sword is at our throats!”\nAt that time this people and Jerusalem will be told, “A scorching wind from the barren heights in the desert blows toward my people, but not to winnow or cleanse; a wind too strong for that comes from me. Now I pronounce my judgments against them.”\nLook! He advances like the clouds,\nhis chariots come like a whirlwind,\nhis horses are swifter than eagles.\nWoe to us! We are ruined!\nJerusalem, wash the evil from your heart and be saved.\nHow long will you harbor wicked thoughts?\nA voice is announcing from Dan,\nproclaiming disaster from the hills of Ephraim.\n“Tell this to the nations,\nproclaim concerning Jerusalem:\n‘A besieging army is coming from a distant land,\nraising a war cry against the cities of Judah.\nThey surround her like men guarding a field,\nbecause she has rebelled against me,’ ”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“Your own conduct and actions\nhave brought this on you.\nThis is your punishment.\nHow bitter it is!\nHow it pierces to the heart!”\n\nOh, my anguish, my anguish!\nI writhe in pain.\nOh, the agony of my heart!\nMy heart pounds within me,\nI cannot keep silent.\nFor I have heard the sound of the trumpet;\nI have heard the battle cry.\nDisaster follows disaster;\nthe whole land lies in ruins.\nIn an instant my tents are destroyed,\nmy shelter in a moment.\nHow long must I see the battle standard\nand hear the sound of the trumpet?\n\n“My people are fools;\nthey do not know me.\nThey are senseless children;\nthey have no understanding.\nThey are skilled in doing evil;\nthey know not how to do good.”\n\nI looked at the earth,\nand it was formless and empty;\nand at the heavens,\nand their light was gone.\nI looked at the mountains,\nand they were quaking;\nall the hills were swaying.\nI looked, and there were no people;\nevery bird in the sky had flown away.\nI looked, and the fruitful land was a desert;\nall its towns lay in ruins\nbefore the LORD, before his fierce anger.\nThis is what the LORD says:\n“The whole land will be ruined,\nthough I will not destroy it completely.\nTherefore the earth will mourn\nand the heavens above grow dark,\nbecause I have spoken and will not relent,\nI have decided and will not turn back.”\n\nAt the sound of horsemen and archers\nevery town takes to flight.\nSome go into the thickets;\nsome climb up among the rocks.\nAll the towns are deserted;\nno one lives in them.\n\nWhat are you doing, you devastated one?\nWhy dress yourself in scarlet\nand put on jewels of gold?\nWhy highlight your eyes with makeup?\nYou adorn yourself in vain.\nYour lovers despise you;\nthey want to kill you.\n\nI hear a cry as of a woman in labor,\na groan as of one bearing her first child—\nthe cry of Daughter Zion gasping for breath,\nstretching out her hands and saying,\n“Alas!

And when the people ask, ‘Why has the LORD our God done all this to us?’ you will tell them, ‘As you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your own land, so now you will serve foreigners in a land not your own.’\n“Announce this to the descendants of Jacob\nand proclaim it in Judah:\nHear this, you foolish and senseless people,\nwho have eyes but do not see,\nwho have ears but do not hear:\nShould you not fear me?” declares the LORD.\n“Should you not tremble in my presence?\nI made the sand a boundary for the sea,\nan everlasting barrier it cannot cross.\nThe waves may roll, but they cannot prevail;\nthey may roar, but they cannot cross it.\nBut these people have stubborn and rebellious hearts;\nthey have turned aside and gone away.\nThey do not say to themselves,\n‘Let us fear the LORD our God,\nwho gives autumn and spring rains in season,\nwho assures us of the regular weeks of harvest.’\nYour wrongdoings have kept these away;\nyour sins have deprived you of good.\n\n“Among my people are the wicked\nwho lie in wait like men who snare birds\nand like those who set traps to catch people.\nLike cages full of birds,\ntheir houses are full of deceit;\nthey have become rich and powerful\nand have grown fat and sleek.\nTheir evil deeds have no limit;\nthey do not seek justice.\nThey do not promote the case of the fatherless;\nthey do not defend the just cause of the poor.\nShould I not punish them for this?”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“Should I not avenge myself\non such a nation as this?\n\n“A horrible and shocking thing\nhas happened in the land:\nThe prophets prophesy lies,\nthe priests rule by their own authority,\nand my people love it this way.\nBut what will you do in the end?",

This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Reform your ways and your actions, and I will let you live in this place. Do not trust in deceptive words and say, “This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD!” If you really change your ways and your actions and deal with each other justly, if you do not oppress the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow and do not shed innocent blood in this place, and if you do not follow other gods to your own harm, then I will let you live in this place, in the land I gave your ancestors for ever and ever. But look, you are trusting in deceptive words that are worthless.\n“ ‘Will you steal and murder, commit adultery and perjury, burn incense to Baal and follow other gods you have not known, and then come and stand before me in this house, which bears my Name, and say, “We are safe”—safe to do all these detestable things? Has this house, which bears my Name, become a den of robbers to you? But I have been watching! declares the LORD.\n“ ‘Go now to the place in Shiloh where I first made a dwelling for my Name, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of my people Israel. While you were doing all these things, declares the LORD, I spoke to you again and again, but you did not listen; I called you, but you did not answer. Therefore, what I did to Shiloh I will now do to the house that bears my Name, the temple you trust in, the place I gave to you and your ancestors. I will thrust you from my presence, just as I did all your fellow Israelites, the people of Ephraim.’\n“So do not pray for this people nor offer any plea or petition for them; do not plead with me, for I will not listen to you. Do you not see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? The children gather wood, the fathers light the fire, and the women knead the dough and make cakes to offer to the Queen of Heaven. They pour out drink offerings to other gods to arouse my anger. But am I the one they are provoking? declares the LORD. Are they not rather harming themselves, to their own shame?\n“ ‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: My anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place—on man and beast, on the trees of the field and on the crops of your land—and it will burn and not be quenched.\n“ ‘This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Go ahead, add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices and eat the meat yourselves! For when I brought your ancestors out of Egypt and spoke to them, I did not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices, but I gave them this command: Obey me, and I will be your God and you will be my people. Walk in obedience to all I command you, that it may go well with you. But they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the stubborn inclinations of their evil hearts. They went backward and not forward. From the time your ancestors left Egypt until now, day after day, again and again I sent you my servants the prophets. But they did not listen to me or pay attention. They were stiff-necked and did more evil than their ancestors.’\n“When you tell them all this, they will not listen to you; when you call to them, they will not answer. Therefore say to them, ‘This is the nation that has not obeyed the LORD its God or responded to correction. Truth has perished; it has vanished from their lips.\n“ ‘Cut off your hair and throw it away; take up a lament on the barren heights, for the LORD has rejected and abandoned this generation that is under his wrath.\n\n“ ‘The people of Judah have done evil in my eyes, declares the LORD. They have set up their detestable idols in the house that bears my Name and have defiled it. They have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to burn their sons and daughters in the fire—something I did not command, nor did it enter my mind. So beware, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when people will no longer call it Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter, for they will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room.

Who has been instructed by the LORD and can explain it? Why has the land been ruined and laid waste like a desert that no one can cross?\nThe LORD said, “It is because they have forsaken my law, which I set before them; they have not obeyed me or followed my law. Instead, they have followed the stubbornness of their hearts; they have followed the Baals, as their ancestors taught them.” Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “See, I will make this people eat bitter food and drink poisoned water. I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their ancestors have known, and I will pursue them with the sword until I have made an end of them.”\nThis is what the LORD Almighty says:\n“Consider now! Call for the wailing women to come;\nsend for the most skillful of them.\nLet them come quickly\nand wail over us\ntill our eyes overflow with tears\nand water streams from our eyelids.\nThe sound of wailing is heard from Zion:\n‘How ruined we are!\nHow great is our shame!\nWe must leave our land\nbecause our houses are in ruins.’ ”\n\nNow, you women, hear the word of the LORD;\nopen your ears to the words of his mouth.\nTeach your daughters how to wail;\nteach one another a lament.\nDeath has climbed in through our windows\nand has entered our fortresses;\nit has removed the children from the streets\nand the young men from the public squares.\nSay, “This is what the LORD declares:\n“ ‘Dead bodies will lie\nlike dung on the open field,\nlike cut grain behind the reaper,\nwith no one to gather them.’ ”\nThis is what the LORD says:\n“Let not the wise boast of their wisdom\nor the strong boast of their strength\nor the rich boast of their riches,\nbut let the one who boasts boast about this:\nthat they have the understanding to know me,\nthat I am the LORD, who exercises kindness,\njustice and righteousness on earth,\nfor in these I delight,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“The days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when I will punish all who are circumcised only in the flesh— Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon, Moab and all who live in the wilderness in distant places. For all these nations are really uncircumcised, and even the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.”",

The report is coming—\na great commotion from the land of the north!\nIt will make the towns of Judah desolate,\na haunt of jackals.\n\nLORD, I know that people’s lives are not their own;\nit is not for them to direct their steps.\nDiscipline me, LORD, but only in due measure—\nnot in your anger,\nor you will reduce me to nothing.\nPour out your wrath on the nations\nthat do not acknowledge you,\non the peoples who do not call on your name.\nFor they have devoured Jacob;\nthey have devoured him completely\nand destroyed his homeland.",

Tell them that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Cursed is the one who does not obey the terms of this covenant— the terms I commanded your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the iron-smelting furnace.’ I said, ‘Obey me and do everything I command you, and you will be my people, and I will be your God. Then I will fulfill the oath I swore to your ancestors, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey’—the land you possess today.”\nI answered, “Amen, LORD.”\nThe LORD said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: ‘Listen to the terms of this covenant and follow them. From the time I brought your ancestors up from Egypt until today, I warned them again and again, saying, “Obey me.” But they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the stubbornness of their evil hearts. So I brought on them all the curses of the covenant I had commanded them to follow but that they did not keep.’ ”\nThen the LORD said to me, “There is a conspiracy among the people of Judah and those who live in Jerusalem. They have returned to the sins of their ancestors, who refused to listen to my words. They have followed other gods to serve them. Both Israel and Judah have broken the covenant I made with their ancestors. Therefore this is what the LORD says: ‘I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape. Although they cry out to me, I will not listen to them. The towns of Judah and the people of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they will not help them at all when disaster strikes. You, Judah, have as many gods as you have towns; and the altars you have set up to burn incense to that shameful god Baal are as many as the streets of Jerusalem.’\n“Do not pray for this people or offer any plea or petition for them, because I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their distress.\n“What is my beloved doing in my temple\nas she, with many others, works out her evil schemes?\nCan consecrated meat avert your punishment?\nWhen you engage in your wickedness,\nthen you rejoice.”\n\nThe LORD called you a thriving olive tree\nwith fruit beautiful in form.\nBut with the roar of a mighty storm\nhe will set it on fire,\nand its branches will be broken.\nThe LORD Almighty, who planted you, has decreed disaster for you, because the people of both Israel and Judah have done evil and aroused my anger by burning incense to Baal.\n\nBecause the LORD revealed their plot to me, I knew it, for at that time he showed me what they were doing. I had been like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter; I did not realize that they had plotted against me, saying,\n“Let us destroy the tree and its fruit;\nlet us cut him off from the land of the living,\nthat his name be remembered no more.”\nBut you, LORD Almighty, who judge righteously\nand test the heart and mind,\nlet me see your vengeance on them,\nfor to you I have committed my cause.\nTherefore this is what the LORD says about the people of Anathoth who are threatening to kill you, saying, “Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD or you will die by our hands”— therefore this is what the LORD Almighty says: “I will punish them. Their young men will die by the sword, their sons and daughters by famine. Not even a remnant will be left to them, because I will bring disaster on the people of Anathoth in the year of their punishment.”",

These wicked people, who refuse to listen to my words, who follow the stubbornness of their hearts and go after other gods to serve and worship them, will be like this belt—completely useless! For as a belt is bound around the waist, so I bound all the people of Israel and all the people of Judah to me,’ declares the LORD, ‘to be my people for my renown and praise and honor. But they have not listened.’\n\n“Say to them: ‘This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Every wineskin should be filled with wine.’ And if they say to you, ‘Don’t we know that every wineskin should be filled with wine?’ then tell them, ‘This is what the LORD says: I am going to fill with drunkenness all who live in this land, including the kings who sit on David’s throne, the priests, the prophets and all those living in Jerusalem. I will smash them one against the other, parents and children alike, declares the LORD. I will allow no pity or mercy or compassion to keep me from destroying them.’ ”\n\nHear and pay attention,\ndo not be arrogant,\nfor the LORD has spoken.\nGive glory to the LORD your God\nbefore he brings the darkness,\nbefore your feet stumble\non the darkening hills.\nYou hope for light,\nbut he will turn it to utter darkness\nand change it to deep gloom.\nIf you do not listen,\nI will weep in secret\nbecause of your pride;\nmy eyes will weep bitterly,\noverflowing with tears,\nbecause the LORD’s flock will be taken captive.\n\nSay to the king and to the queen mother,\n“Come down from your thrones,\nfor your glorious crowns\nwill fall from your heads.”\nThe cities in the Negev will be shut up,\nand there will be no one to open them.\nAll Judah will be carried into exile,\ncarried completely away.\n\nLook up and see\nthose who are coming from the north.\nWhere is the flock that was entrusted to you,\nthe sheep of which you boasted?\nWhat will you say when the LORD sets over you\nthose you cultivated as your special allies?\nWill not pain grip you\nlike that of a woman in labor?\nAnd if you ask yourself,\n“Why has this happened to me?”—\nit is because of your many sins\nthat your skirts have been torn off\nand your body mistreated.\nCan an Ethiopian change his skin\nor a leopard its spots?\nNeither can you do good\nwho are accustomed to doing evil.\n\n“I will scatter you like chaff\ndriven by the desert wind.\nThis is your lot,\nthe portion I have decreed for you,”\ndeclares the LORD,\n“because you have forgotten me\nand trusted in false gods.\nI will pull up your skirts over your face\nthat your shame may be seen—\nyour adulteries and lustful neighings,\nyour shameless prostitution!\nI have seen your detestable acts\non the hills and in the fields.\nWoe to you, Jerusalem!\nHow long will you be unclean?”",

Although they fast, I will not listen to their cry; though they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them. Instead, I will destroy them with the sword, famine and plague.”\nBut I said, “Alas, Sovereign LORD! The prophets keep telling them, ‘You will not see the sword or suffer famine. Indeed, I will give you lasting peace in this place.’ ”\nThen the LORD said to me, “The prophets are prophesying lies in my name. I have not sent them or appointed them or spoken to them. They are prophesying to you false visions, divinations, idolatries and the delusions of their own minds. Therefore this is what the LORD says about the prophets who are prophesying in my name: I did not send them, yet they are saying, ‘No sword or famine will touch this land.’ Those same prophets will perish by sword and famine. And the people they are prophesying to will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and sword. There will be no one to bury them, their wives, their sons and their daughters. I will pour out on them the calamity they deserve.\n“Speak this word to them:\n“ ‘Let my eyes overflow with tears\nnight and day without ceasing;\nfor the Virgin Daughter, my people,\nhas suffered a grievous wound,\na crushing blow.\nIf I go into the country,\nI see those slain by the sword;\nif I go into the city,\nI see the ravages of famine.\nBoth prophet and priest\nhave gone to a land they know not.’ ”\n\nHave you rejected Judah completely?\nDo you despise Zion?\nWhy have you afflicted us\nso that we cannot be healed?\nWe hoped for peace\nbut no good has come,\nfor a time of healing\nbut there is only terror.\nWe acknowledge our wickedness, LORD,\nand the guilt of our ancestors;\nwe have indeed sinned against you.\nFor the sake of your name do not despise us;\ndo not dishonor your glorious throne.\nRemember your covenant with us\nand do not break it.\nDo any of the worthless idols of the nations bring rain?\nDo the skies themselves send down showers?\nNo, it is you, LORD our God.\nTherefore our hope is in you,\nfor you are the one who does all this.",

They will not be mourned or buried but will be like dung lying on the ground. They will perish by sword and famine, and their dead bodies will become food for the birds and the wild animals.”\nFor this is what the LORD says: “Do not enter a house where there is a funeral meal; do not go to mourn or show sympathy, because I have withdrawn my blessing, my love and my pity from this people,” declares the LORD. “Both high and low will die in this land. They will not be buried or mourned, and no one will cut themselves or shave their head for the dead. No one will offer food to comfort those who mourn for the dead—not even for a father or a mother—nor will anyone give them a drink to console them.\n“And do not enter a house where there is feasting and sit down to eat and drink. For this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Before your eyes and in your days I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of bride and bridegroom in this place.\n“When you tell these people all this and they ask you, ‘Why has the LORD decreed such a great disaster against us? What wrong have we done? What sin have we committed against the LORD our God?’ then say to them, ‘It is because your ancestors forsook me,’ declares the LORD, ‘and followed other gods and served and worshiped them. They forsook me and did not keep my law. But you have behaved more wickedly than your ancestors. See how all of you are following the stubbornness of your evil hearts instead of obeying me. So I will throw you out of this land into a land neither you nor your ancestors have known, and there you will serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.’\n“However, the days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when it will no longer be said, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt,’ but it will be said, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the Israelites up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them.’ For I will restore them to the land I gave their ancestors.\n“But now I will send for many fishermen,” declares the LORD, “and they will catch them. After that I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them down on every mountain and hill and from the crevices of the rocks. My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from me, nor is their sin concealed from my eyes. I will repay them double for their wickedness and their sin, because they have defiled my land with the lifeless forms of their vile images and have filled my inheritance with their detestable idols.”\nLORD, my strength and my fortress,\nmy refuge in time of distress,\nto you the nations will come\nfrom the ends of the earth and say,\n“Our ancestors possessed nothing but false gods,\nworthless idols that did them no good.\nDo people make their own gods?\nYes, but they are not gods!”\n\n“Therefore I will teach them—\nthis time I will teach them\nmy power and might.\nThen they will know\nthat my name is the LORD.",

Say to them, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, you kings of Judah and all people of Judah and everyone living in Jerusalem who come through these gates. This is what the LORD says: Be careful not to carry a load on the Sabbath day or bring it through the gates of Jerusalem. Do not bring a load out of your houses or do any work on the Sabbath, but keep the Sabbath day holy, as I commanded your ancestors. Yet they did not listen or pay attention; they were stiff-necked and would not listen or respond to discipline. But if you are careful to obey me, declares the LORD, and bring no load through the gates of this city on the Sabbath, but keep the Sabbath day holy by not doing any work on it, then kings who sit on David’s throne will come through the gates of this city with their officials. They and their officials will come riding in chariots and on horses, accompanied by the men of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, and this city will be inhabited forever. People will come from the towns of Judah and the villages around Jerusalem, from the territory of Benjamin and the western foothills, from the hill country and the Negev, bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and incense, and bringing thank offerings to the house of the LORD. But if you do not obey me to keep the Sabbath day holy by not carrying any load as you come through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will kindle an unquenchable fire in the gates of Jerusalem that will consume her fortresses.’ ”",

But the pot he was shaping from the clay was marred in his hands; so the potter formed it into another pot, shaping it as seemed best to him.\nThen the word of the LORD came to me. He said, “Can I not do with you, Israel, as this potter does?” declares the LORD. “Like clay in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, Israel. If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down and destroyed, and if that nation I warned repents of its evil, then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned. And if at another time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be built up and planted, and if it does evil in my sight and does not obey me, then I will reconsider the good I had intended to do for it.\n“Now therefore say to the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, ‘This is what the LORD says: Look! I am preparing a disaster for you and devising a plan against you. So turn from your evil ways, each one of you, and reform your ways and your actions.’ But they will reply, ‘It’s no use. We will continue with our own plans; we will all follow the stubbornness of our evil hearts.’ ”\nTherefore this is what the LORD says:\n“Inquire among the nations:\nWho has ever heard anything like this?\nA most horrible thing has been done\nby Virgin Israel.\nDoes the snow of Lebanon\never vanish from its rocky slopes?\nDo its cool waters from distant sources\never stop flowing?\nYet my people have forgotten me;\nthey burn incense to worthless idols,\nwhich made them stumble in their ways,\nin the ancient paths.\nThey made them walk in byways,\non roads not built up.\nTheir land will be an object of horror\nand of lasting scorn;\nall who pass by will be appalled\nand will shake their heads.\nLike a wind from the east,\nI will scatter them before their enemies;\nI will show them my back and not my face\nin the day of their disaster.”\nThey said, “Come, let’s make plans against Jeremiah; for the teaching of the law by the priest will not cease, nor will counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophets. So come, let’s attack him with our tongues and pay no attention to anything he says.”\nListen to me, LORD;\nhear what my accusers are saying!\nShould good be repaid with evil?\nYet they have dug a pit for me.\nRemember that I stood before you\nand spoke in their behalf\nto turn your wrath away from them.\nSo give their children over to famine;\nhand them over to the power of the sword.\nLet their wives be made childless and widows;\nlet their men be put to death,\ntheir young men slain by the sword in battle.\nLet a cry be heard from their houses\nwhen you suddenly bring invaders against them,\nfor they have dug a pit to capture me\nand have hidden snares for my feet.\nBut you, LORD, know\nall their plots to kill me.\nDo not forgive their crimes\nor blot out their sins from your sight.\nLet them be overthrown before you;\ndeal with them in the time of your anger.",

There proclaim the words I tell you, and say, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, you kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem. This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Listen! I am going to bring a disaster on this place that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle. For they have forsaken me and made this a place of foreign gods; they have burned incense in it to gods that neither they nor their ancestors nor the kings of Judah ever knew, and they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent. They have built the high places of Baal to burn their children in the fire as offerings to Baal—something I did not command or mention, nor did it enter my mind. So beware, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when people will no longer call this place Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter.\n“ ‘In this place I will ruin the plans of Judah and Jerusalem. I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies, at the hands of those who want to kill them, and I will give their carcasses as food to the birds and the wild animals. I will devastate this city and make it an object of horror and scorn; all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff because of all its wounds. I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters, and they will eat one another’s flesh because their enemies will press the siege so hard against them to destroy them.’\n“Then break the jar while those who go with you are watching, and say to them, ‘This is what the LORD Almighty says: I will smash this nation and this city just as this potter’s jar is smashed and cannot be repaired. They will bury the dead in Topheth until there is no more room. This is what I will do to this place and to those who live here, declares the LORD. I will make this city like Topheth.

Perhaps the LORD will perform wonders for us as in times past so that he will withdraw from us.”\nBut Jeremiah answered them, “Tell Zedekiah, ‘This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I am about to turn against you the weapons of war that are in your hands, which you are using to fight the king of Babylon and the Babylonians who are outside the wall besieging you. And I will gather them inside this city. I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm in furious anger and in great wrath. I will strike down those who live in this city—both man and beast—and they will die of a terrible plague. After that, declares the LORD, I will give Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials and the people in this city who survive the plague, sword and famine, into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to their enemies who want to kill them. He will put them to the sword; he will show them no mercy or pity or compassion.’\n“Furthermore, tell the people, ‘This is what the LORD says: See, I am setting before you the way of life and the way of death. Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine or plague. But whoever goes out and surrenders to the Babylonians who are besieging you will live; they will escape with their lives. I have determined to do this city harm and not good, declares the LORD. It will be given into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will destroy it with fire.’\n“Moreover, say to the royal house of Judah, ‘Hear the word of the LORD. This is what the LORD says to you, house of David:\n“ ‘Administer justice every morning;\nrescue from the hand of the oppressor\nthe one who has been robbed,\nor my wrath will break out and burn like fire\nbecause of the evil you have done—\nburn with no one to quench it.\nI am against you, Jerusalem,\nyou who live above this valley\non the rocky plateau, declares the LORD—\nyou who say, “Who can come against us?\nWho can enter our refuge?”\nI will punish you as your deeds deserve,\ndeclares the LORD.\nI will kindle a fire in your forests\nthat will consume everything around you.’ ”",

This is what the LORD says: Do what is just and right. Rescue from the hand of the oppressor the one who has been robbed. Do no wrong or violence to the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place. For if you are careful to carry out these commands, then kings who sit on David’s throne will come through the gates of this palace, riding in chariots and on horses, accompanied by their officials and their people. But if you do not obey these commands, declares the LORD, I swear by myself that this palace will become a ruin.’ ”\nFor this is what the LORD says about the palace of the king of Judah:\n“Though you are like Gilead to me,\nlike the summit of Lebanon,\nI will surely make you like a wasteland,\nlike towns not inhabited.\nI will send destroyers against you,\neach man with his weapons,\nand they will cut up your fine cedar beams\nand throw them into the fire.\n“People from many nations will pass by this city and will ask one another, ‘Why has the LORD done such a thing to this great city?’ And the answer will be: ‘Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God and have worshiped and served other gods.’ ”\nDo not weep for the dead king or mourn his loss;\nrather, weep bitterly for him who is exiled,\nbecause he will never return\nnor see his native land again.\nFor this is what the LORD says about Shallum son of Josiah, who succeeded his father as king of Judah but has gone from this place: “He will never return. He will die in the place where they have led him captive; he will not see this land again.”\n“Woe to him who builds his palace by unrighteousness,\nhis upper rooms by injustice,\nmaking his own people work for nothing,\nnot paying them for their labor.\nHe says, ‘I will build myself a great palace\nwith spacious upper rooms.’\nSo he makes large windows in it,\npanels it with cedar\nand decorates it in red.\n\n“Does it make you a king\nto have more and more cedar?\nDid not your father have food and drink?\nHe did what was right and just,\nso all went well with him.\nHe defended the cause of the poor and needy,\nand so all went well.\nIs that not what it means to know me?”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“But your eyes and your heart\nare set only on dishonest gain,\non shedding innocent blood\nand on oppression and extortion.”\nTherefore this is what the LORD says about Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah:\n“They will not mourn for him:\n‘Alas, my brother! Alas, my sister!’\nThey will not mourn for him:\n‘Alas, my master! Alas, his splendor!’\nHe will have the burial of a donkey—\ndragged away and thrown\noutside the gates of Jerusalem.”\n\n“Go up to Lebanon and cry out,\nlet your voice be heard in Bashan,\ncry out from Abarim,\nfor all your allies are crushed.\nI warned you when you felt secure,\nbut you said, ‘I will not listen!’\nThis has been your way from your youth;\nyou have not obeyed me.\nThe wind will drive all your shepherds away,\nand your allies will go into exile.\nThen you will be ashamed and disgraced\nbecause of all your wickedness.\nYou who live in ‘Lebanon,’\nwho are nestled in cedar buildings,\nhow you will groan when pangs come upon you,\npain like that of a woman in labor!\n“As surely as I live,” declares the LORD, “even if you, Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, were a signet ring on my right hand, I would still pull you off. I will deliver you into the hands of those who want to kill you, those you fear—Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the Babylonians. I will hurl you and the mother who gave you birth into another country, where neither of you was born, and there you both will die. You will never come back to the land you long to return to.”\nIs this man Jehoiachin a despised, broken pot,\nan object no one wants?\nWhy will he and his children be hurled out,\ncast into a land they do not know?\nO land, land, land,\nhear the word of the LORD!\nThis is what the LORD says:\n“Record this man as if childless,\na man who will not prosper in his lifetime,\nfor none of his offspring will prosper,\nnone will sit on the throne of David\nor rule anymore in Judah.”",

Therefore this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to the shepherds who tend my people: “Because you have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not bestowed care on them, I will bestow punishment on you for the evil you have done,” declares the LORD. “I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them and will bring them back to their pasture, where they will be fruitful and increase in number. I will place shepherds over them who will tend them, and they will no longer be afraid or terrified, nor will any be missing,” declares the LORD.\n“The days are coming,” declares the LORD,\n“when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch,\na King who will reign wisely\nand do what is just and right in the land.\nIn his days Judah will be saved\nand Israel will live in safety.\nThis is the name by which he will be called:\nThe LORD Our Righteous Savior.\n“So then, the days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when people will no longer say, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt,’ but they will say, ‘As surely as the LORD lives, who brought the descendants of Israel up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them.’ Then they will live in their own land.”\n\nConcerning the prophets:\nMy heart is broken within me;\nall my bones tremble.\nI am like a drunken man,\nlike a strong man overcome by wine,\nbecause of the LORD\nand his holy words.\nThe land is full of adulterers;\nbecause of the curse the land lies parched\nand the pastures in the wilderness are withered.\nThe prophets follow an evil course\nand use their power unjustly.\n\n“Both prophet and priest are godless;\neven in my temple I find their wickedness,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“Therefore their path will become slippery;\nthey will be banished to darkness\nand there they will fall.\nI will bring disaster on them\nin the year they are punished,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n\n“Among the prophets of Samaria\nI saw this repulsive thing:\nThey prophesied by Baal\nand led my people Israel astray.\nAnd among the prophets of Jerusalem\nI have seen something horrible:\nThey commit adultery and live a lie.\nThey strengthen the hands of evildoers,\nso that not one of them turns from their wickedness.\nThey are all like Sodom to me;\nthe people of Jerusalem are like Gomorrah.”\nTherefore this is what the LORD Almighty says concerning the prophets:\n“I will make them eat bitter food\nand drink poisoned water,\nbecause from the prophets of Jerusalem\nungodliness has spread throughout the land.”\nThis is what the LORD Almighty says:\n“Do not listen to what the prophets are prophesying to you;\nthey fill you with false hopes.\nThey speak visions from their own minds,\nnot from the mouth of the LORD.\nThey keep saying to those who despise me,\n‘The LORD says: You will have peace.’\nAnd to all who follow the stubbornness of their hearts\nthey say, ‘No harm will come to you.’\nBut which of them has stood in the council of the LORD\nto see or to hear his word?\nWho has listened and heard his word?\nSee, the storm of the LORD\nwill burst out in wrath,\na whirlwind swirling down\non the heads of the wicked.\nThe anger of the LORD will not turn back\nuntil he fully accomplishes\nthe purposes of his heart.\nIn days to come\nyou will understand it clearly.\nI did not send these prophets,\nyet they have run with their message;\nI did not speak to them,\nyet they have prophesied.\nBut if they had stood in my council,\nthey would have proclaimed my words to my people\nand would have turned them from their evil ways\nand from their evil deeds.\n\n“Am I only a God nearby,”\ndeclares the LORD,\n“and not a God far away?\nWho can hide in secret places\nso that I cannot see them?”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“Do not I fill heaven and earth?”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“I have heard what the prophets say who prophesy lies in my name. They say, ‘I had a dream! I had a dream!’ How long will this continue in the hearts of these lying prophets, who prophesy the delusions of their own minds? They think the dreams they tell one another will make my people forget my name, just as their ancestors forgot my name through Baal worship. Let the prophet who has a dream recount the dream, but let the one who has my word speak it faithfully. For what has straw to do with grain?” declares the LORD. “Is not my word like fire,” declares the LORD, “and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces?\n“Therefore,” declares the LORD, “I am against the prophets who steal from one another words supposedly from me. Yes,” declares the LORD, “I am against the prophets who wag their own tongues and yet declare, ‘The LORD declares.’ Indeed, I am against those who prophesy false dreams,” declares the LORD. “They tell them and lead my people astray with their reckless lies, yet I did not send or appoint them. They do not benefit these people in the least,” declares the LORD.\n\n“When these people, or a prophet or a priest, ask you, ‘What is the message from the LORD?’ say to them, ‘What message? I will forsake you, declares the LORD.’ If a prophet or a priest or anyone else claims, ‘This is a message from the LORD,’ I will punish them and their household. This is what each of you keeps saying to your friends and other Israelites: ‘What is the LORD’s answer?’ or ‘What has the LORD spoken?’ But you must not mention ‘a message from the LORD’ again, because each one’s word becomes their own message. So you distort the words of the living God, the LORD Almighty, our God. This is what you keep saying to a prophet: ‘What is the LORD’s answer to you?’ or ‘What has the LORD spoken?’ Although you claim, ‘This is a message from the LORD,’ this is what the LORD says: You used the words, ‘This is a message from the LORD,’ even though I told you that you must not claim, ‘This is a message from the LORD.’ Therefore, I will surely forget you and cast you out of my presence along with the city I gave to you and your ancestors. I will bring on you everlasting disgrace—everlasting shame that will not be forgotten.”",

My eyes will watch over them for their good, and I will bring them back to this land. I will build them up and not tear them down; I will plant them and not uproot them.

      "chapter_text": "The word came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. So Jeremiah the prophet said to all the people of Judah and to all those living in Jerusalem: For twenty-three years—from the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah until this very day—the word of the LORD has come to me and I have spoken to you again and again, but you have not listened.\nAnd though the LORD has sent all his servants the prophets to you again and again, you have not listened or paid any attention. They said, “Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways and your evil practices, and you can stay in the land the LORD gave to you and your ancestors for ever and ever. Do not follow other gods to serve and worship them; do not arouse my anger with what your hands have made. Then I will not harm you.”\n“But you did not listen to me,” declares the LORD, “and you have aroused my anger with what your hands have made, and you have brought harm to yourselves.”\nTherefore the LORD Almighty says this: “Because you have not listened to my words, I will summon all the peoples of the north and my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,” declares the LORD, “and I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants and against all the surrounding nations. I will completely destroy them and make them an object of horror and scorn, and an everlasting ruin. I will banish from them the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of bride and bridegroom, the sound of millstones and the light of the lamp. This whole country will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years.\n“But when the seventy years are fulfilled, I will punish the king of Babylon and his nation, the land of the Babylonians, for their guilt,” declares the LORD, “and will make it desolate forever. I will bring on that land all the things I have spoken against it, all that are written in this book and prophesied by Jeremiah against all the nations. They themselves will be enslaved by many nations and great kings; I will repay them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.”\n\nThis is what the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me: “Take from my hand this cup filled with the wine of my wrath and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it. When they drink it, they will stagger and go mad because of the sword I will send among them.”\nSo I took the cup from the LORD’s hand and made all the nations to whom he sent me drink it: Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, its kings and officials, to make them a ruin and an object of horror and scorn, a curse—as they are today; Pharaoh king of Egypt, his attendants, his officials and all his people, and all the foreign people there; all the kings of Uz; all the kings of the Philistines (those of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the people left at Ashdod); Edom, Moab and Ammon; all the kings of Tyre and Sidon; the kings of the coastlands across the sea; Dedan, Tema, Buz and all who are in distant places; all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the foreign people who live in the wilderness; all the kings of Zimri, Elam and Media; and all the kings of the north, near and far, one after the other—all the kingdoms on the face of the earth. And after all of them, the king of Sheshak will drink it too.\n“Then tell them, ‘This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Drink, get drunk and vomit, and fall to rise no more because of the sword I will send among you.’ But if they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink, tell them, ‘This is what the LORD Almighty says: You must drink it! See, I am beginning to bring disaster on the city that bears my Name, and will you indeed go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I am calling down a sword on all who live on the earth, declares the LORD Almighty.’\n“Now prophesy all these words against them and say to them:\n“ ‘The LORD will roar from on high;\nhe will thunder from his holy dwelling\nand roar mightily against his land.\nHe will shout like those who tread the grapes,\nshout against all who live on the earth.\nThe tumult will resound to the ends of the earth,\nfor the LORD will bring charges against the nations;\nhe will bring judgment on all mankind\nand put the wicked to the sword,’ ”\ndeclares the LORD.\nThis is what the LORD Almighty says:\n“Look! Disaster is spreading\nfrom nation to nation;\na mighty storm is rising\nfrom the ends of the earth.”\nAt that time those slain by the LORD will be everywhere—from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be mourned or gathered up or buried, but will be like dung lying on the ground.\nWeep and wail, you shepherds;\nroll in the dust, you leaders of the flock.\nFor your time to be slaughtered has come;\nyou will fall like the best of the rams.\nThe shepherds will have nowhere to flee,\nthe leaders of the flock no place to escape.\nHear the cry of the shepherds,\nthe wailing of the leaders of the flock,\nfor the LORD is destroying their pasture.\nThe peaceful meadows will be laid waste\nbecause of the fierce anger of the LORD.\nLike a lion he will leave his lair,\nand their land will become desolate\nbecause of the sword of the oppressor\nand because of the LORD’s fierce anger.",

Tell them everything I command you; do not omit a word. Perhaps they will listen and each will turn from their evil ways. Then I will relent and not inflict on them the disaster I was planning because of the evil they have done. Say to them, ‘This is what the LORD says: If you do not listen to me and follow my law, which I have set before you, and if you do not listen to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I have sent to you again and again (though you have not listened), then I will make this house like Shiloh and this city a curse among all the nations of the earth.’ ”\nThe priests, the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speak these words in the house of the LORD. But as soon as Jeremiah finished telling all the people everything the LORD had commanded him to say, the priests, the prophets and all the people seized him and said, “You must die! Why do you prophesy in the LORD’s name that this house will be like Shiloh and this city will be desolate and deserted?” And all the people crowded around Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.\nWhen the officials of Judah heard about these things, they went up from the royal palace to the house of the LORD and took their places at the entrance of the New Gate of the LORD’s house. Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and all the people, “This man should be sentenced to death because he has prophesied against this city. You have heard it with your own ears!”\nThen Jeremiah said to all the officials and all the people: “The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the things you have heard. Now reform your ways and your actions and obey the LORD your God. Then the LORD will relent and not bring the disaster he has pronounced against you. As for me, I am in your hands; do with me whatever you think is good and right. Be assured, however, that if you put me to death, you will bring the guilt of innocent blood on yourselves and on this city and on those who live in it, for in truth the LORD has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing.”\nThen the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, “This man should not be sentenced to death! He has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.”\nSome of the elders of the land stepped forward and said to the entire assembly of people, “Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah. He told all the people of Judah, ‘This is what the LORD Almighty says:\n“ ‘Zion will be plowed like a field,\nJerusalem will become a heap of rubble,\nthe temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets.’\n“Did Hezekiah king of Judah or anyone else in Judah put him to death? Did not Hezekiah fear the LORD and seek his favor? And did not the LORD relent, so that he did not bring the disaster he pronounced against them? We are about to bring a terrible disaster on ourselves!”\n(Now Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath Jearim was another man who prophesied in the name of the LORD; he prophesied the same things against this city and this land as Jeremiah did. When King Jehoiakim and all his officers and officials heard his words, the king was determined to put him to death. But Uriah heard of it and fled in fear to Egypt. King Jehoiakim, however, sent Elnathan son of Akbor to Egypt, along with some other men. They brought Uriah out of Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim, who had him struck down with a sword and his body thrown into the burial place of the common people.)\nFurthermore, Ahikam son of Shaphan supported Jeremiah, and so he was not handed over to the people to be put to death.",

Then send word to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre and Sidon through the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah. Give them a message for their masters and say, ‘This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “Tell this to your masters: With my great power and outstretched arm I made the earth and its people and the animals that are on it, and I give it to anyone I please. Now I will give all your countries into the hands of my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; I will make even the wild animals subject to him. All nations will serve him and his son and his grandson until the time for his land comes; then many nations and great kings will subjugate him.\n“ ‘ “If, however, any nation or kingdom will not serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon or bow its neck under his yoke, I will punish that nation with the sword, famine and plague, declares the LORD, until I destroy it by his hand. So do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your interpreters of dreams, your mediums or your sorcerers who tell you, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon.’ They prophesy lies to you that will only serve to remove you far from your lands; I will banish you and you will perish. But if any nation will bow its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will let that nation remain in its own land to till it and to live there, declares the LORD.” ’ ”\nI gave the same message to Zedekiah king of Judah. I said, “Bow your neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon; serve him and his people, and you will live. Why will you and your people die by the sword, famine and plague with which the LORD has threatened any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? Do not listen to the words of the prophets who say to you, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they are prophesying lies to you. ‘I have not sent them,’ declares the LORD. ‘They are prophesying lies in my name. Therefore, I will banish you and you will perish, both you and the prophets who prophesy to you.’ ”\nThen I said to the priests and all these people, “This is what the LORD says: Do not listen to the prophets who say, ‘Very soon now the articles from the LORD’s house will be brought back from Babylon.’ They are prophesying lies to you. Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon, and you will live. Why should this city become a ruin? If they are prophets and have the word of the LORD, let them plead with the LORD Almighty that the articles remaining in the house of the LORD and in the palace of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem not be taken to Babylon. For this is what the LORD Almighty says about the pillars, the bronze Sea, the movable stands and the other articles that are left in this city, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take away when he carried Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem— yes, this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says about the things that are left in the house of the LORD and in the palace of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem: ‘They will be taken to Babylon and there they will remain until the day I come for them,’ declares the LORD. ‘Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.’ ”",

Within two years I will bring back to this place all the articles of the LORD’s house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon removed from here and took to Babylon. I will also bring back to this place Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and all the other exiles from Judah who went to Babylon,’ declares the LORD, ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’ ”\nThen the prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah before the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the LORD. He said, “Amen! May the LORD do so! May the LORD fulfill the words you have prophesied by bringing the articles of the LORD’s house and all the exiles back to this place from Babylon. Nevertheless, listen to what I have to say in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people: From early times the prophets who preceded you and me have prophesied war, disaster and plague against many countries and great kingdoms. But the prophet who prophesies peace will be recognized as one truly sent by the LORD only if his prediction comes true.”\nThen the prophet Hananiah took the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and broke it, and he said before all the people, “This is what the LORD says: ‘In the same way I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon off the neck of all the nations within two years.’ ” At this, the prophet Jeremiah went on his way.\nAfter the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: “Go and tell Hananiah, ‘This is what the LORD says: You have broken a wooden yoke, but in its place you will get a yoke of iron. This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will put an iron yoke on the necks of all these nations to make them serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they will serve him. I will even give him control over the wild animals.’ ”\nThen the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, “Listen, Hananiah!

      "chapter_text": "This is the text of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to the surviving elders among the exiles and to the priests, the prophets and all the other people Nebuchadnezzar had carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon. (This was after King Jehoiachin and the queen mother, the court officials and the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the skilled workers and the artisans had gone into exile from Jerusalem.) He entrusted the letter to Elasah son of Shaphan and to Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to King Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon. It said:\nThis is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says to all those I carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: “Build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce. Marry and have sons and daughters; find wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage, so that they too may have sons and daughters. Increase in number there; do not decrease. Also, seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I have carried you into exile. Pray to the LORD for it, because if it prospers, you too will prosper.” Yes, this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “Do not let the prophets and diviners among you deceive you. Do not listen to the dreams you encourage them to have. They are prophesying lies to you in my name. I have not sent them,” declares the LORD.\nThis is what the LORD says: “When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will come to you and fulfill my good promise to bring you back to this place. For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. I will be found by you,” declares the LORD, “and will bring you back from captivity. I will gather you from all the nations and places where I have banished you,” declares the LORD, “and will bring you back to the place from which I carried you into exile.”\nYou may say, “The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,” but this is what the LORD says about the king who sits on David’s throne and all the people who remain in this city, your fellow citizens who did not go with you into exile— yes, this is what the LORD Almighty says: “I will send the sword, famine and plague against them and I will make them like figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten. I will pursue them with the sword, famine and plague and will make them abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse and an object of horror, of scorn and reproach, among all the nations where I drive them. For they have not listened to my words,” declares the LORD, “words that I sent to them again and again by my servants the prophets. And you exiles have not listened either,” declares the LORD.\nTherefore, hear the word of the LORD, all you exiles whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon. This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says about Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying lies to you in my name: “I will deliver them into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will put them to death before your very eyes. Because of them, all the exiles from Judah who are in Babylon will use this curse: ‘May the LORD treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon burned in the fire.’ For they have done outrageous things in Israel; they have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and in my name they have uttered lies—which I did not authorize. I know it and am a witness to it,” declares the LORD.\n\nTell Shemaiah the Nehelamite, “This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You sent letters in your own name to all the people in Jerusalem, to the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, and to all the other priests. You said to Zephaniah, ‘The LORD has appointed you priest in place of Jehoiada to be in charge of the house of the LORD; you should put any maniac who acts like a prophet into the stocks and neck-irons. So why have you not reprimanded Jeremiah from Anathoth, who poses as a prophet among you? He has sent this message to us in Babylon: It will be a long time. Therefore build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce.’ ”\nZephaniah the priest, however, read the letter to Jeremiah the prophet. Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: “Send this message to all the exiles: ‘This is what the LORD says about Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, even though I did not send him, and has persuaded you to trust in lies, this is what the LORD says: I will surely punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants. He will have no one left among this people, nor will he see the good things I will do for my people, declares the LORD, because he has preached rebellion against me.’ ”",

I will refresh the weary and satisfy the faint.”\nAt this I awoke and looked around. My sleep had been pleasant to me.\n“The days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when I will plant the kingdoms of Israel and Judah with the offspring of people and of animals. Just as I watched over them to uproot and tear down, and to overthrow, destroy and bring disaster, so I will watch over them to build and to plant,” declares the LORD. “In those days people will no longer say,\n‘The parents have eaten sour grapes,\nand the children’s teeth are set on edge.’\nInstead, everyone will die for their own sin; whoever eats sour grapes—their own teeth will be set on edge.\n“The days are coming,” declares the LORD,\n“when I will make a new covenant\nwith the people of Israel\nand with the people of Judah.\nIt will not be like the covenant\nI made with their ancestors\nwhen I took them by the hand\nto lead them out of Egypt,\nbecause they broke my covenant,\nthough I was a husband to them,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel\nafter that time,” declares the LORD.\n“I will put my law in their minds\nand write it on their hearts.\nI will be their God,\nand they will be my people.\nNo longer will they teach their neighbor,\nor say to one another, ‘Know the LORD,’\nbecause they will all know me,\nfrom the least of them to the greatest,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“For I will forgive their wickedness\nand will remember their sins no more.”\nThis is what the LORD says,\nhe who appoints the sun\nto shine by day,\nwho decrees the moon and stars\nto shine by night,\nwho stirs up the sea\nso that its waves roar—\nthe LORD Almighty is his name:\n“Only if these decrees vanish from my sight,”\ndeclares the LORD,\n“will Israel ever cease\nbeing a nation before me.”\nThis is what the LORD says:\n“Only if the heavens above can be measured\nand the foundations of the earth below be searched out\nwill I reject all the descendants of Israel\nbecause of all they have done,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“The days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when this city will be rebuilt for me from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. The measuring line will stretch from there straight to the hill of Gareb and then turn to Goah. The whole valley where dead bodies and ashes are thrown, and all the terraces out to the Kidron Valley on the east as far as the corner of the Horse Gate, will be holy to the LORD. The city will never again be uprooted or demolished.”",

      "chapter_text": "This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. The army of the king of Babylon was then besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace of Judah.\nNow Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him there, saying, “Why do you prophesy as you do? You say, ‘This is what the LORD says: I am about to give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it. Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape the Babylonians but will certainly be given into the hands of the king of Babylon, and will speak with him face to face and see him with his own eyes. He will take Zedekiah to Babylon, where he will remain until I deal with him, declares the LORD. If you fight against the Babylonians, you will not succeed.’ ”\nJeremiah said, “The word of the LORD came to me: Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle is going to come to you and say, ‘Buy my field at Anathoth, because as nearest relative it is your right and duty to buy it.’\n“Then, just as the LORD had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard and said, ‘Buy my field at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. Since it is your right to redeem it and possess it, buy it for yourself.’\n“I knew that this was the word of the LORD; so I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel and weighed out for him seventeen shekels of silver. I signed and sealed the deed, had it witnessed, and weighed out the silver on the scales. I took the deed of purchase—the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions, as well as the unsealed copy— and I gave this deed to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel and of the witnesses who had signed the deed and of all the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard.\n“In their presence I gave Baruch these instructions: ‘This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Take these documents, both the sealed and unsealed copies of the deed of purchase, and put them in a clay jar so they will last a long time. For this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Houses, fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land.’\n“After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD:\n“Ah, Sovereign LORD, you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too hard for you. You show love to thousands but bring the punishment for the parents’ sins into the laps of their children after them. Great and mighty God, whose name is the LORD Almighty, great are your purposes and mighty are your deeds. Your eyes are open to the ways of all mankind; you reward each person according to their conduct and as their deeds deserve. You performed signs and wonders in Egypt and have continued them to this day, in Israel and among all mankind, and have gained the renown that is still yours. You brought your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with great terror. You gave them this land you had sworn to give their ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey. They came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey you or follow your law; they did not do what you commanded them to do. So you brought all this disaster on them.\n“See how the siege ramps are built up to take the city. Because of the sword, famine and plague, the city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians who are attacking it. What you said has happened, as you now see. And though the city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians, you, Sovereign LORD, say to me, ‘Buy the field with silver and have the transaction witnessed.’ ”\nThen the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: “I am the LORD, the God of all mankind. Is anything too hard for me? Therefore this is what the LORD says: I am about to give this city into the hands of the Babylonians and to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who will capture it. The Babylonians who are attacking this city will come in and set it on fire; they will burn it down, along with the houses where the people aroused my anger by burning incense on the roofs to Baal and by pouring out drink offerings to other gods.\n“The people of Israel and Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight from their youth; indeed, the people of Israel have done nothing but arouse my anger with what their hands have made, declares the LORD. From the day it was built until now, this city has so aroused my anger and wrath that I must remove it from my sight. The people of Israel and Judah have provoked me by all the evil they have done—they, their kings and officials, their priests and prophets, the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem. They turned their backs to me and not their faces; though I taught them again and again, they would not listen or respond to discipline. They set up their vile images in the house that bears my Name and defiled it. They built high places for Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molek, though I never commanded—nor did it enter my mind—that they should do such a detestable thing and so make Judah sin.\n“You are saying about this city, ‘By the sword, famine and plague it will be given into the hands of the king of Babylon’; but this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I will surely gather them from all the lands where I banish them in my furious anger and great wrath; I will bring them back to this place and let them live in safety. They will be my people, and I will be their God. I will give them singleness of heart and action, so that they will always fear me and that all will then go well for them and for their children after them. I will make an everlasting covenant with them: I will never stop doing good to them, and I will inspire them to fear me, so that they will never turn away from me. I will rejoice in doing them good and will assuredly plant them in this land with all my heart and soul.\n“This is what the LORD says: As I have brought all this great calamity on this people, so I will give them all the prosperity I have promised them. Once more fields will be bought in this land of which you say, ‘It is a desolate waste, without people or animals, for it has been given into the hands of the Babylonians.’ Fields will be bought for silver, and deeds will be signed, sealed and witnessed in the territory of Benjamin, in the villages around Jerusalem, in the towns of Judah and in the towns of the hill country, of the western foothills and of the Negev, because I will restore their fortunes, declares the LORD.”",

I will hide my face from this city because of all its wickedness.\n“ ‘Nevertheless, I will bring health and healing to it; I will heal my people and will let them enjoy abundant peace and security. I will bring Judah and Israel back from captivity and will rebuild them as they were before. I will cleanse them from all the sin they have committed against me and will forgive all their sins of rebellion against me. Then this city will bring me renown, joy, praise and honor before all nations on earth that hear of all the good things I do for it; and they will be in awe and will tremble at the abundant prosperity and peace I provide for it.’\n“This is what the LORD says: ‘You say about this place, “It is a desolate waste, without people or animals.” Yet in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are deserted, inhabited by neither people nor animals, there will be heard once more the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of bride and bridegroom, and the voices of those who bring thank offerings to the house of the LORD, saying,\n“Give thanks to the LORD Almighty,\nfor the LORD is good;\nhis love endures forever.”\nFor I will restore the fortunes of the land as they were before,’ says the LORD.\n“This is what the LORD Almighty says: ‘In this place, desolate and without people or animals—in all its towns there will again be pastures for shepherds to rest their flocks. In the towns of the hill country, of the western foothills and of the Negev, in the territory of Benjamin, in the villages around Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah, flocks will again pass under the hand of the one who counts them,’ says the LORD.\n“ ‘The days are coming,’ declares the LORD, ‘when I will fulfill the good promise I made to the people of Israel and Judah.\n“ ‘In those days and at that time\nI will make a righteous Branch sprout from David’s line;\nhe will do what is just and right in the land.\nIn those days Judah will be saved\nand Jerusalem will live in safety.\nThis is the name by which it will be called:\nThe LORD Our Righteous Savior.’\nFor this is what the LORD says: ‘David will never fail to have a man to sit on the throne of Israel, nor will the Levitical priests ever fail to have a man to stand before me continually to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings and to present sacrifices.’ ”\nThe word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: “This is what the LORD says: ‘If you can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night, so that day and night no longer come at their appointed time, then my covenant with David my servant—and my covenant with the Levites who are priests ministering before me—can be broken and David will no longer have a descendant to reign on his throne. I will make the descendants of David my servant and the Levites who minister before me as countless as the stars in the sky and as measureless as the sand on the seashore.’ ”\nThe word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: “Have you not noticed that these people are saying, ‘The LORD has rejected the two kingdoms he chose’? So they despise my people and no longer regard them as a nation. This is what the LORD says: ‘If I have not made my covenant with day and night and established the laws of heaven and earth, then I will reject the descendants of Jacob and David my servant and will not choose one of his sons to rule over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. For I will restore their fortunes and have compassion on them.’ ”",

      "chapter_text": "While Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms and peoples in the empire he ruled were fighting against Jerusalem and all its surrounding towns, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD: “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Go to Zedekiah king of Judah and tell him, ‘This is what the LORD says: I am about to give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down. You will not escape from his grasp but will surely be captured and given into his hands. You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes, and he will speak with you face to face. And you will go to Babylon.\n“ ‘Yet hear the LORD’s promise to you, Zedekiah king of Judah. This is what the LORD says concerning you: You will not die by the sword; you will die peacefully. As people made a funeral fire in honor of your predecessors, the kings who ruled before you, so they will make a fire in your honor and lament, “Alas, master!” I myself make this promise, declares the LORD.’ ”\nThen Jeremiah the prophet told all this to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem, while the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and the other cities of Judah that were still holding out—Lachish and Azekah. These were the only fortified cities left in Judah.\n\nThe word came to Jeremiah from the LORD after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim freedom for the slaves. Everyone was to free their Hebrew slaves, both male and female; no one was to hold a fellow Hebrew in bondage. So all the officials and people who entered into this covenant agreed that they would free their male and female slaves and no longer hold them in bondage. They agreed, and set them free. But afterward they changed their minds and took back the slaves they had freed and enslaved them again.\nThen the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. I said, ‘Every seventh year each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who have sold themselves to you. After they have served you six years, you must let them go free.’ Your ancestors, however, did not listen to me or pay attention to me. Recently you repented and did what is right in my sight: Each of you proclaimed freedom to your own people. You even made a covenant before me in the house that bears my Name. But now you have turned around and profaned my name; each of you has taken back the male and female slaves you had set free to go where they wished. You have forced them to become your slaves again.\n“Therefore this is what the LORD says: You have not obeyed me; you have not proclaimed freedom to your own people. So I now proclaim ‘freedom’ for you, declares the LORD—‘freedom’ to fall by the sword, plague and famine. I will make you abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth. Those who have violated my covenant and have not fulfilled the terms of the covenant they made before me, I will treat like the calf they cut in two and then walked between its pieces. The leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the court officials, the priests and all the people of the land who walked between the pieces of the calf, I will deliver into the hands of their enemies who want to kill them. Their dead bodies will become food for the birds and the wild animals.\n“I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials into the hands of their enemies who want to kill them, to the army of the king of Babylon, which has withdrawn from you. I am going to give the order, declares the LORD, and I will bring them back to this city. They will fight against it, take it and burn it down. And I will lay waste the towns of Judah so no one can live there.”",

I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the room of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah the man of God. It was next to the room of the officials, which was over that of Maaseiah son of Shallum the doorkeeper. Then I set bowls full of wine and some cups before the Rekabites and said to them, “Drink some wine.”\nBut they replied, “We do not drink wine, because our forefather Jehonadab son of Rekab gave us this command: ‘Neither you nor your descendants must ever drink wine. Also you must never build houses, sow seed or plant vineyards; you must never have any of these things, but must always live in tents. Then you will live a long time in the land where you are nomads.’ We have obeyed everything our forefather Jehonadab son of Rekab commanded us. Neither we nor our wives nor our sons and daughters have ever drunk wine or built houses to live in or had vineyards, fields or crops. We have lived in tents and have fully obeyed everything our forefather Jehonadab commanded us. But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded this land, we said, ‘Come, we must go to Jerusalem to escape the Babylonian and Aramean armies.’ So we have remained in Jerusalem.”\nThen the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying: “This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Go and tell the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, ‘Will you not learn a lesson and obey my words?’ declares the LORD. ‘Jehonadab son of Rekab ordered his descendants not to drink wine and this command has been kept. To this day they do not drink wine, because they obey their forefather’s command. But I have spoken to you again and again, yet you have not obeyed me. Again and again I sent all my servants the prophets to you. They said, “Each of you must turn from your wicked ways and reform your actions; do not follow other gods to serve them. Then you will live in the land I have given to you and your ancestors.” But you have not paid attention or listened to me. The descendants of Jehonadab son of Rekab have carried out the command their forefather gave them, but these people have not obeyed me.’\n“Therefore this is what the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘Listen! I am going to bring on Judah and on everyone living in Jerusalem every disaster I pronounced against them. I spoke to them, but they did not listen; I called to them, but they did not answer.’ ”\nThen Jeremiah said to the family of the Rekabites, “This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘You have obeyed the command of your forefather Jehonadab and have followed all his instructions and have done everything he ordered.’ Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘Jehonadab son of Rekab will never fail to have a descendant to serve me.’ ”",

      "chapter_text": "In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD: “Take a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah and all the other nations from the time I began speaking to you in the reign of Josiah till now. Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about every disaster I plan to inflict on them, they will each turn from their wicked ways; then I will forgive their wickedness and their sin.”\nSo Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and while Jeremiah dictated all the words the LORD had spoken to him, Baruch wrote them on the scroll. Then Jeremiah told Baruch, “I am restricted; I am not allowed to go to the LORD’s temple. So you go to the house of the LORD on a day of fasting and read to the people from the scroll the words of the LORD that you wrote as I dictated. Read them to all the people of Judah who come in from their towns. Perhaps they will bring their petition before the LORD and will each turn from their wicked ways, for the anger and wrath pronounced against this people by the LORD are great.”\nBaruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do; at the LORD’s temple he read the words of the LORD from the scroll. In the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, a time of fasting before the LORD was proclaimed for all the people in Jerusalem and those who had come from the towns of Judah. From the room of Gemariah son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the temple, Baruch read to all the people at the LORD’s temple the words of Jeremiah from the scroll.\nWhen Micaiah son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll, he went down to the secretary’s room in the royal palace, where all the officials were sitting: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Akbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials. After Micaiah told them everything he had heard Baruch read to the people from the scroll, all the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, “Bring the scroll from which you have read to the people and come.” So Baruch son of Neriah went to them with the scroll in his hand. They said to him, “Sit down, please, and read it to us.”\nSo Baruch read it to them. When they heard all these words, they looked at each other in fear and said to Baruch, “We must report all these words to the king.” Then they asked Baruch, “Tell us, how did you come to write all this? Did Jeremiah dictate it?”\n“Yes,” Baruch replied, “he dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them in ink on the scroll.”\nThen the officials said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah, go and hide. Don’t let anyone know where you are.”\nAfter they put the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary, they went to the king in the courtyard and reported everything to him. The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and Jehudi brought it from the room of Elishama the secretary and read it to the king and all the officials standing beside him. It was the ninth month and the king was sitting in the winter apartment, with a fire burning in the firepot in front of him. Whenever Jehudi had read three or four columns of the scroll, the king cut them off with a scribe’s knife and threw them into the firepot, until the entire scroll was burned in the fire. The king and all his attendants who heard all these words showed no fear, nor did they tear their clothes. Even though Elnathan, Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them. Instead, the king commanded Jerahmeel, a son of the king, Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But the LORD had hidden them.\nAfter the king burned the scroll containing the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah’s dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: “Take another scroll and write on it all the words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah burned up. Also tell Jehoiakim king of Judah, ‘This is what the LORD says: You burned that scroll and said, “Why did you write on it that the king of Babylon would certainly come and destroy this land and wipe from it both man and beast?” Therefore this is what the LORD says about Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have no one to sit on the throne of David; his body will be thrown out and exposed to the heat by day and the frost by night.

Neither he nor his attendants nor the people of the land paid any attention to the words the LORD had spoken through Jeremiah the prophet.\nKing Zedekiah, however, sent Jehukal son of Shelemiah with the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to Jeremiah the prophet with this message: “Please pray to the LORD our God for us.”\nNow Jeremiah was free to come and go among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison. Pharaoh’s army had marched out of Egypt, and when the Babylonians who were besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.\nThen the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet: “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of me, ‘Pharaoh’s army, which has marched out to support you, will go back to its own land, to Egypt. Then the Babylonians will return and attack this city; they will capture it and burn it down.’\n“This is what the LORD says: Do not deceive yourselves, thinking, ‘The Babylonians will surely leave us.’ They will not! Even if you were to defeat the entire Babylonian army that is attacking you and only wounded men were left in their tents, they would come out and burn this city down.”\nAfter the Babylonian army had withdrawn from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army, Jeremiah started to leave the city to go to the territory of Benjamin to get his share of the property among the people there. But when he reached the Benjamin Gate, the captain of the guard, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, arrested him and said, “You are deserting to the Babylonians!”\n“That’s not true!” Jeremiah said. “I am not deserting to the Babylonians.” But Irijah would not listen to him; instead, he arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials. They were angry with Jeremiah and had him beaten and imprisoned in the house of Jonathan the secretary, which they had made into a prison.\nJeremiah was put into a vaulted cell in a dungeon, where he remained a long time. Then King Zedekiah sent for him and had him brought to the palace, where he asked him privately, “Is there any word from the LORD?”\n“Yes,” Jeremiah replied, “you will be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon.”\nThen Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “What crime have I committed against you or your attendants or this people, that you have put me in prison? Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, ‘The king of Babylon will not attack you or this land’? But now, my lord the king, please listen. Let me bring my petition before you: Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, or I will die there.”\nKing Zedekiah then gave orders for Jeremiah to be placed in the courtyard of the guard and given a loaf of bread from the street of the bakers each day until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.",

They will escape with their lives; they will live.’ And this is what the LORD says: ‘This city will certainly be given into the hands of the army of the king of Babylon, who will capture it.’ ”\nThen the officials said to the king, “This man should be put to death. He is discouraging the soldiers who are left in this city, as well as all the people, by the things he is saying to them. This man is not seeking the good of these people but their ruin.”\n“He is in your hands,” King Zedekiah answered. “The king can do nothing to oppose you.”\nSo they took Jeremiah and put him into the cistern of Malkijah, the king’s son, which was in the courtyard of the guard. They lowered Jeremiah by ropes into the cistern; it had no water in it, only mud, and Jeremiah sank down into the mud.\nBut Ebed-Melek, a Cushite, an official in the royal palace, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern. While the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate, Ebed-Melek went out of the palace and said to him, “My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all they have done to Jeremiah the prophet. They have thrown him into a cistern, where he will starve to death when there is no longer any bread in the city.”\nThen the king commanded Ebed-Melek the Cushite, “Take thirty men from here with you and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.”\nSo Ebed-Melek took the men with him and went to a room under the treasury in the palace. He took some old rags and worn-out clothes from there and let them down with ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern. Ebed-Melek the Cushite said to Jeremiah, “Put these old rags and worn-out clothes under your arms to pad the ropes.” Jeremiah did so, and they pulled him up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.\n\nThen King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and had him brought to the third entrance to the temple of the LORD. “I am going to ask you something,” the king said to Jeremiah. “Do not hide anything from me.”\nJeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I give you an answer, will you not kill me? Even if I did give you counsel, you would not listen to me.”\nBut King Zedekiah swore this oath secretly to Jeremiah: “As surely as the LORD lives, who has given us breath, I will neither kill you nor hand you over to those who want to kill you.”\nThen Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “This is what the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, your life will be spared and this city will not be burned down; you and your family will live. But if you will not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, this city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians and they will burn it down; you yourself will not escape from them.’ ”\nKing Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have gone over to the Babylonians, for the Babylonians may hand me over to them and they will mistreat me.”\n“They will not hand you over,” Jeremiah replied. “Obey the LORD by doing what I tell you. Then it will go well with you, and your life will be spared. But if you refuse to surrender, this is what the LORD has revealed to me: All the women left in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon. Those women will say to you:\n“ ‘They misled you and overcame you—\nthose trusted friends of yours.\nYour feet are sunk in the mud;\nyour friends have deserted you.’\n“All your wives and children will be brought out to the Babylonians. You yourself will not escape from their hands but will be captured by the king of Babylon; and this city will be burned down.”\nThen Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Do not let anyone know about this conversation, or you may die. If the officials hear that I talked with you, and they come to you and say, ‘Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; do not hide it from us or we will kill you,’ then tell them, ‘I was pleading with the king not to send me back to Jonathan’s house to die there.’ ”\nAll the officials did come to Jeremiah and question him, and he told them everything the king had ordered him to say. So they said no more to him, for no one had heard his conversation with the king.\nAnd Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard until the day Jerusalem was captured.\n\nThis is how Jerusalem was taken:",

Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came and took seats in the Middle Gate: Nergal-Sharezer of Samgar, Nebo-Sarsekim a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer a high official and all the other officials of the king of Babylon. When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled; they left the city at night by way of the king’s garden, through the gate between the two walls, and headed toward the Arabah.\nBut the Babylonian army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. They captured him and took him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced sentence on him. There at Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes and also killed all the nobles of Judah. Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him with bronze shackles to take him to Babylon.\nThe Babylonians set fire to the royal palace and the houses of the people and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard carried into exile to Babylon the people who remained in the city, along with those who had gone over to him, and the rest of the people. But Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard left behind in the land of Judah some of the poor people, who owned nothing; and at that time he gave them vineyards and fields.\nNow Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had given these orders about Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard: “Take him and look after him; don’t harm him but do for him whatever he asks.” So Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard, Nebushazban a chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer a high official and all the other officers of the king of Babylon sent and had Jeremiah taken out of the courtyard of the guard. They turned him over to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him back to his home. So he remained among his own people.\nWhile Jeremiah had been confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word of the LORD came to him: “Go and tell Ebed-Melek the Cushite, ‘This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I am about to fulfill my words against this city—words concerning disaster, not prosperity. At that time they will be fulfilled before your eyes. But I will rescue you on that day, declares the LORD; you will not be given into the hands of those you fear. I will save you; you will not fall by the sword but will escape with your life, because you trust in me, declares the LORD.’ ”",

Look, the whole country lies before you; go wherever you please.” However, before Jeremiah turned to go, Nebuzaradan added, “Go back to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the towns of Judah, and live with him among the people, or go anywhere else you please.”\nThen the commander gave him provisions and a present and let him go. So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah and stayed with him among the people who were left behind in the land.\n\nWhen all the army officers and their men who were still in the open country heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam as governor over the land and had put him in charge of the men, women and children who were the poorest in the land and who had not been carried into exile to Babylon, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maakathite, and their men. Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, took an oath to reassure them and their men. “Do not be afraid to serve the Babylonians,” he said. “Settle down in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you. I myself will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians who come to us, but you are to harvest the wine, summer fruit and olive oil, and put them in your storage jars, and live in the towns you have taken over.”\nWhen all the Jews in Moab, Ammon, Edom and all the other countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, as governor over them, they all came back to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, from all the countries where they had been scattered. And they harvested an abundance of wine and summer fruit.\nJohanan son of Kareah and all the army officers still in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah and said to him, “Don’t you know that Baalis king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah son of Ahikam did not believe them.\nThen Johanan son of Kareah said privately to Gedaliah in Mizpah, “Let me go and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life and cause all the Jews who are gathered around you to be scattered and the remnant of Judah to perish?”\nBut Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, “Don’t do such a thing! What you are saying about Ishmael is not true.”",

While they were eating together there, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him got up and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword, killing the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land. Ishmael also killed all the men of Judah who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, as well as the Babylonian soldiers who were there.\nThe day after Gedaliah’s assassination, before anyone knew about it, eighty men who had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes and cut themselves came from Shechem, Shiloh and Samaria, bringing grain offerings and incense with them to the house of the LORD. Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. When he met them, he said, “Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam.” When they went into the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern. But ten of them said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us! We have wheat and barley, olive oil and honey, hidden in a field.” So he let them alone and did not kill them with the others. Now the cistern where he threw all the bodies of the men he had killed along with Gedaliah was the one King Asa had made as part of his defense against Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the dead.\nIshmael made captives of all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah—the king’s daughters along with all the others who were left there, over whom Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites.\nWhen Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him heard about all the crimes Ishmael son of Nethaniah had committed, they took all their men and went to fight Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They caught up with him near the great pool in Gibeon. When all the people Ishmael had with him saw Johanan son of Kareah and the army officers who were with him, they were glad. All the people Ishmael had taken captive at Mizpah turned and went over to Johanan son of Kareah. But Ishmael son of Nethaniah and eight of his men escaped from Johanan and fled to the Ammonites.\n\nThen Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him led away all the people of Mizpah who had survived, whom Johanan had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah after Ishmael had assassinated Gedaliah son of Ahikam—the soldiers, women, children and court officials he had recovered from Gibeon. And they went on, stopping at Geruth Kimham near Bethlehem on their way to Egypt to escape the Babylonians. They were afraid of them because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land.",

For as you now see, though we were once many, now only a few are left. Pray that the LORD your God will tell us where we should go and what we should do.”\n“I have heard you,” replied Jeremiah the prophet. “I will certainly pray to the LORD your God as you have requested; I will tell you everything the LORD says and will keep nothing back from you.”\nThen they said to Jeremiah, “May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act in accordance with everything the LORD your God sends you to tell us. Whether it is favorable or unfavorable, we will obey the LORD our God, to whom we are sending you, so that it will go well with us, for we will obey the LORD our God.”\nTen days later the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah. So he called together Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him and all the people from the least to the greatest. He said to them, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your petition, says: ‘If you stay in this land, I will build you up and not tear you down; I will plant you and not uproot you, for I have relented concerning the disaster I have inflicted on you. Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you now fear. Do not be afraid of him, declares the LORD, for I am with you and will save you and deliver you from his hands. I will show you compassion so that he will have compassion on you and restore you to your land.’\n“However, if you say, ‘We will not stay in this land,’ and so disobey the LORD your God, and if you say, ‘No, we will go and live in Egypt, where we will not see war or hear the trumpet or be hungry for bread,’ then hear the word of the LORD, you remnant of Judah. This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you are determined to go to Egypt and you do go to settle there, then the sword you fear will overtake you there, and the famine you dread will follow you into Egypt, and there you will die. Indeed, all who are determined to go to Egypt to settle there will die by the sword, famine and plague; not one of them will survive or escape the disaster I will bring on them.’ This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘As my anger and wrath have been poured out on those who lived in Jerusalem, so will my wrath be poured out on you when you go to Egypt. You will be a curse and an object of horror, a curse and an object of reproach; you will never see this place again.’\n“Remnant of Judah, the LORD has told you, ‘Do not go to Egypt.’ Be sure of this: I warn you today that you made a fatal mistake when you sent me to the LORD your God and said, ‘Pray to the LORD our God for us; tell us everything he says and we will do it.’ I have told you today, but you still have not obeyed the LORD your God in all he sent me to tell you. So now, be sure of this: You will die by the sword, famine and plague in the place where you want to go to settle.”",

The LORD our God has not sent you to say, ‘You must not go to Egypt to settle there.’ But Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us to hand us over to the Babylonians, so they may kill us or carry us into exile to Babylon.”\nSo Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers and all the people disobeyed the LORD’s command to stay in the land of Judah. Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers led away all the remnant of Judah who had come back to live in the land of Judah from all the nations where they had been scattered. They also led away all those whom Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan—the men, the women, the children and the king’s daughters. And they took Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah along with them. So they entered Egypt in disobedience to the LORD and went as far as Tahpanhes.\nIn Tahpanhes the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: “While the Jews are watching, take some large stones with you and bury them in clay in the brick pavement at the entrance to Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes. Then say to them, ‘This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will send for my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and I will set his throne over these stones I have buried here; he will spread his royal canopy above them. He will come and attack Egypt, bringing death to those destined for death, captivity to those destined for captivity, and the sword to those destined for the sword. He will set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt; he will burn their temples and take their gods captive. As a shepherd picks his garment clean of lice, so he will pick Egypt clean and depart. There in the temple of the sun in Egypt he will demolish the sacred pillars and will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt.’ ”",

Today they lie deserted and in ruins because of the evil they have done. They aroused my anger by burning incense to and worshiping other gods that neither they nor you nor your ancestors ever knew. Again and again I sent my servants the prophets, who said, ‘Do not do this detestable thing that I hate!’ But they did not listen or pay attention; they did not turn from their wickedness or stop burning incense to other gods. Therefore, my fierce anger was poured out; it raged against the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem and made them the desolate ruins they are today.\n“Now this is what the LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Why bring such great disaster on yourselves by cutting off from Judah the men and women, the children and infants, and so leave yourselves without a remnant? Why arouse my anger with what your hands have made, burning incense to other gods in Egypt, where you have come to live? You will destroy yourselves and make yourselves a curse and an object of reproach among all the nations on earth. Have you forgotten the wickedness committed by your ancestors and by the kings and queens of Judah and the wickedness committed by you and your wives in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem? To this day they have not humbled themselves or shown reverence, nor have they followed my law and the decrees I set before you and your ancestors.\n“Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I am determined to bring disaster on you and to destroy all Judah. I will take away the remnant of Judah who were determined to go to Egypt to settle there. They will all perish in Egypt; they will fall by the sword or die from famine. From the least to the greatest, they will die by sword or famine. They will become a curse and an object of horror, a curse and an object of reproach. I will punish those who live in Egypt with the sword, famine and plague, as I punished Jerusalem. None of the remnant of Judah who have gone to live in Egypt will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah, to which they long to return and live; none will return except a few fugitives.”\nThen all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, along with all the women who were present—a large assembly—and all the people living in Lower and Upper Egypt, said to Jeremiah, “We will not listen to the message you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD! We will certainly do everything we said we would: We will burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and will pour out drink offerings to her just as we and our ancestors, our kings and our officials did in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. At that time we had plenty of food and were well off and suffered no harm. But ever since we stopped burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have had nothing and have been perishing by sword and famine.”\nThe women added, “When we burned incense to the Queen of Heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, did not our husbands know that we were making cakes impressed with her image and pouring out drink offerings to her?”\nThen Jeremiah said to all the people, both men and women, who were answering him, “Did not the LORD remember and call to mind the incense burned in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem by you and your ancestors, your kings and your officials and the people of the land? When the LORD could no longer endure your wicked actions and the detestable things you did, your land became a curse and a desolate waste without inhabitants, as it is today. Because you have burned incense and have sinned against the LORD and have not obeyed him or followed his law or his decrees or his stipulations, this disaster has come upon you, as you now see.”\nThen Jeremiah said to all the people, including the women, “Hear the word of the LORD, all you people of Judah in Egypt. This is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says: You and your wives have done what you said you would do when you promised, ‘We will certainly carry out the vows we made to burn incense and pour out drink offerings to the Queen of Heaven.’\n“Go ahead then, do what you promised! Keep your vows! But hear the word of the LORD, all you Jews living in Egypt: ‘I swear by my great name,’ says the LORD, ‘that no one from Judah living anywhere in Egypt will ever again invoke my name or swear, “As surely as the Sovereign LORD lives.” For I am watching over them for harm, not for good; the Jews in Egypt will perish by sword and famine until they are all destroyed. Those who escape the sword and return to the land of Judah from Egypt will be very few. Then the whole remnant of Judah who came to live in Egypt will know whose word will stand—mine or theirs.\n“ ‘This will be the sign to you that I will punish you in this place,’ declares the LORD, ‘so that you will know that my threats of harm against you will surely stand.’ This is what the LORD says: ‘I am going to deliver Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hands of his enemies who want to kill him, just as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the enemy who wanted to kill him.’ ”",

I will give them into the hands of those who want to kill them—Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his officers. Later, however, Egypt will be inhabited as in times past,” declares the LORD.\n“Do not be afraid, Jacob my servant;\ndo not be dismayed, Israel.\nI will surely save you out of a distant place,\nyour descendants from the land of their exile.\nJacob will again have peace and security,\nand no one will make him afraid.\nDo not be afraid, Jacob my servant,\nfor I am with you,” declares the LORD.\n“Though I completely destroy all the nations\namong which I scatter you,\nI will not completely destroy you.\nI will discipline you but only in due measure;\nI will not let you go entirely unpunished.”",

Run for your lives;\nbecome like a bush in the desert.\nSince you trust in your deeds and riches,\nyou too will be taken captive,\nand Chemosh will go into exile,\ntogether with his priests and officials.\nThe destroyer will come against every town,\nand not a town will escape.\nThe valley will be ruined\nand the plateau destroyed,\nbecause the LORD has spoken.\nPut salt on Moab,\nfor she will be laid waste;\nher towns will become desolate,\nwith no one to live in them.\n\n“A curse on anyone who is lax in doing the LORD’s work!\nA curse on anyone who keeps their sword from bloodshed!\n\n“Moab has been at rest from youth,\nlike wine left on its dregs,\nnot poured from one jar to another—\nshe has not gone into exile.\nSo she tastes as she did,\nand her aroma is unchanged.\nBut days are coming,”\ndeclares the LORD,\n“when I will send men who pour from pitchers,\nand they will pour her out;\nthey will empty her pitchers\nand smash her jars.\nThen Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh,\nas Israel was ashamed\nwhen they trusted in Bethel.\n\n“How can you say, ‘We are warriors,\nmen valiant in battle’?\nMoab will be destroyed and her towns invaded;\nher finest young men will go down in the slaughter,”\ndeclares the King, whose name is the LORD Almighty.\n“The fall of Moab is at hand;\nher calamity will come quickly.\nMourn for her, all who live around her,\nall who know her fame;\nsay, ‘How broken is the mighty scepter,\nhow broken the glorious staff!’\n\n“Come down from your glory\nand sit on the parched ground,\nyou inhabitants of Daughter Dibon,\nfor the one who destroys Moab\nwill come up against you\nand ruin your fortified cities.\nStand by the road and watch,\nyou who live in Aroer.\nAsk the man fleeing and the woman escaping,\nask them, ‘What has happened?’\nMoab is disgraced, for she is shattered.\nWail and cry out!\nAnnounce by the Arnon\nthat Moab is destroyed.\nJudgment has come to the plateau—\nto Holon, Jahzah and Mephaath,\nto Dibon, Nebo and Beth Diblathaim,\nto Kiriathaim, Beth Gamul and Beth Meon,\nto Kerioth and Bozrah—\nto all the towns of Moab, far and near.\nMoab’s horn is cut off;\nher arm is broken,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n\n“Make her drunk,\nfor she has defied the LORD.\nLet Moab wallow in her vomit;\nlet her be an object of ridicule.\nWas not Israel the object of your ridicule?\nWas she caught among thieves,\nthat you shake your head in scorn\nwhenever you speak of her?\nAbandon your towns and dwell among the rocks,\nyou who live in Moab.\nBe like a dove that makes its nest\nat the mouth of a cave.\n\n“We have heard of Moab’s pride—\nhow great is her arrogance!—\nof her insolence, her pride, her conceit\nand the haughtiness of her heart.\nI know her insolence but it is futile,”\ndeclares the LORD,\n“and her boasts accomplish nothing.\nTherefore I wail over Moab,\nfor all Moab I cry out,\nI moan for the people of Kir Hareseth.\nI weep for you, as Jazer weeps,\nyou vines of Sibmah.\nYour branches spread as far as the sea;\nthey reached as far as Jazer.\nThe destroyer has fallen\non your ripened fruit and grapes.\nJoy and gladness are gone\nfrom the orchards and fields of Moab.\nI have stopped the flow of wine from the presses;\nno one treads them with shouts of joy.\nAlthough there are shouts,\nthey are not shouts of joy.\n\n“The sound of their cry rises\nfrom Heshbon to Elealeh and Jahaz,\nfrom Zoar as far as Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah,\nfor even the waters of Nimrim are dried up.\nIn Moab I will put an end\nto those who make offerings on the high places\nand burn incense to their gods,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“So my heart laments for Moab like the music of a pipe;\nit laments like a pipe for the people of Kir Hareseth.\nThe wealth they acquired is gone.\nEvery head is shaved\nand every beard cut off;\nevery hand is slashed\nand every waist is covered with sackcloth.\nOn all the roofs in Moab\nand in the public squares\nthere is nothing but mourning,\nfor I have broken Moab\nlike a jar that no one wants,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“How shattered she is! How they wail!\nHow Moab turns her back in shame!\nMoab has become an object of ridicule,\nan object of horror to all those around her.”\nThis is what the LORD says:\n“Look! An eagle is swooping down,\nspreading its wings over Moab.\nKerioth will be captured\nand the strongholds taken.\nIn that day the hearts of Moab’s warriors\nwill be like the heart of a woman in labor.\nMoab will be destroyed as a nation\nbecause she defied the LORD.\nTerror and pit and snare await you,\nyou people of Moab,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“Whoever flees from the terror\nwill fall into a pit,\nwhoever climbs out of the pit\nwill be caught in a snare;\nfor I will bring on Moab\nthe year of her punishment,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n\n“In the shadow of Heshbon\nthe fugitives stand helpless,\nfor a fire has gone out from Heshbon,\na blaze from the midst of Sihon;\nit burns the foreheads of Moab,\nthe skulls of the noisy boasters.\nWoe to you, Moab!\nThe people of Chemosh are destroyed;\nyour sons are taken into exile\nand your daughters into captivity.\n\n“Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab\nin days to come,”\ndeclares the LORD.\nHere ends the judgment on Moab.",

You will not go unpunished, but must drink it. I swear by myself,” declares the LORD, “that Bozrah will become a ruin and a curse, an object of horror and reproach; and all its towns will be in ruins forever.”\nI have heard a message from the LORD;\nan envoy was sent to the nations to say,\n“Assemble yourselves to attack it!\nRise up for battle!”\n\n“Now I will make you small among the nations,\ndespised by mankind.\nThe terror you inspire\nand the pride of your heart have deceived you,\nyou who live in the clefts of the rocks,\nwho occupy the heights of the hill.\nThough you build your nest as high as the eagle’s,\nfrom there I will bring you down,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“Edom will become an object of horror;\nall who pass by will be appalled and will scoff\nbecause of all its wounds.\nAs Sodom and Gomorrah were overthrown,\nalong with their neighboring towns,”\nsays the LORD,\n“so no one will live there;\nno people will dwell in it.\n\n“Like a lion coming up from Jordan’s thickets\nto a rich pastureland,\nI will chase Edom from its land in an instant.\nWho is the chosen one I will appoint for this?\nWho is like me and who can challenge me?\nAnd what shepherd can stand against me?”\n\nTherefore, hear what the LORD has planned against Edom,\nwhat he has purposed against those who live in Teman:\nThe young of the flock will be dragged away;\ntheir pasture will be appalled at their fate.\nAt the sound of their fall the earth will tremble;\ntheir cry will resound to the Red Sea.\nLook! An eagle will soar and swoop down,\nspreading its wings over Bozrah.\nIn that day the hearts of Edom’s warriors\nwill be like the heart of a woman in labor.\n\nConcerning Damascus:\n“Hamath and Arpad are dismayed,\nfor they have heard bad news.\nThey are disheartened,\ntroubled like the restless sea.\nDamascus has become feeble,\nshe has turned to flee\nand panic has gripped her;\nanguish and pain have seized her,\npain like that of a woman in labor.\nWhy has the city of renown not been abandoned,\nthe town in which I delight?\nSurely, her young men will fall in the streets;\nall her soldiers will be silenced in that day,”\ndeclares the LORD Almighty.\n“I will set fire to the walls of Damascus;\nit will consume the fortresses of Ben-Hadad.”\n\nConcerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked:\n\nThis is what the LORD says:\n“Arise, and attack Kedar\nand destroy the people of the East.\nTheir tents and their flocks will be taken;\ntheir shelters will be carried off\nwith all their goods and camels.\nPeople will shout to them,\n‘Terror on every side!’\n\n“Flee quickly away!\nStay in deep caves, you who live in Hazor,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has plotted against you;\nhe has devised a plan against you.\n\n“Arise and attack a nation at ease,\nwhich lives in confidence,”\ndeclares the LORD,\n“a nation that has neither gates nor bars;\nits people live far from danger.\nTheir camels will become plunder,\nand their large herds will be spoils of war.\nI will scatter to the winds those who are in distant places\nand will bring disaster on them from every side,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“Hazor will become a haunt of jackals,\na desolate place forever.\nNo one will live there;\nno people will dwell in it.”\n\nThis is the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, early in the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah:\n\nThis is what the LORD Almighty says:\n“See, I will break the bow of Elam,\nthe mainstay of their might.\nI will bring against Elam the four winds\nfrom the four quarters of heaven;\nI will scatter them to the four winds,\nand there will not be a nation\nwhere Elam’s exiles do not go.\nI will shatter Elam before their foes,\nbefore those who want to kill them;\nI will bring disaster on them,\neven my fierce anger,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“I will pursue them with the sword\nuntil I have made an end of them.\nI will set my throne in Elam\nand destroy her king and officials,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n\n“Yet I will restore the fortunes of Elam\nin days to come,”\ndeclares the LORD.",

to devastate her land;\nthey will oppose her on every side\nin the day of her disaster.\nLet not the archer string his bow,\nnor let him put on his armor.\nDo not spare her young men;\ncompletely destroy her army.\nThey will fall down slain in Babylon,\nfatally wounded in her streets.\nFor Israel and Judah have not been forsaken\nby their God, the LORD Almighty,\nthough their land is full of guilt\nbefore the Holy One of Israel.\n\n“Flee from Babylon!\nRun for your lives!\nDo not be destroyed because of her sins.\nIt is time for the LORD’s vengeance;\nhe will repay her what she deserves.\nBabylon was a gold cup in the LORD’s hand;\nshe made the whole earth drunk.\nThe nations drank her wine;\ntherefore they have now gone mad.\nBabylon will suddenly fall and be broken.\nWail over her!\nGet balm for her pain;\nperhaps she can be healed.\n\n“ ‘We would have healed Babylon,\nbut she cannot be healed;\nlet us leave her and each go to our own land,\nfor her judgment reaches to the skies,\nit rises as high as the heavens.’\n\n“ ‘The LORD has vindicated us;\ncome, let us tell in Zion\nwhat the LORD our God has done.’\n\n“Sharpen the arrows,\ntake up the shields!\nThe LORD has stirred up the kings of the Medes,\nbecause his purpose is to destroy Babylon.\nThe LORD will take vengeance,\nvengeance for his temple.\nLift up a banner against the walls of Babylon!\nReinforce the guard,\nstation the watchmen,\nprepare an ambush!\nThe LORD will carry out his purpose,\nhis decree against the people of Babylon.\nYou who live by many waters\nand are rich in treasures,\nyour end has come,\nthe time for you to be destroyed.\nThe LORD Almighty has sworn by himself:\nI will surely fill you with troops, as with a swarm of locusts,\nand they will shout in triumph over you.\n\n“He made the earth by his power;\nhe founded the world by his wisdom\nand stretched out the heavens by his understanding.\nWhen he thunders, the waters in the heavens roar;\nhe makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth.\nHe sends lightning with the rain\nand brings out the wind from his storehouses.\n\n“Everyone is senseless and without knowledge;\nevery goldsmith is shamed by his idols.\nThe images he makes are a fraud;\nthey have no breath in them.\nThey are worthless, the objects of mockery;\nwhen their judgment comes, they will perish.\nHe who is the Portion of Jacob is not like these,\nfor he is the Maker of all things,\nincluding the people of his inheritance—\nthe LORD Almighty is his name.\n\n“You are my war club,\nmy weapon for battle—\nwith you I shatter nations,\nwith you I destroy kingdoms,\nwith you I shatter horse and rider,\nwith you I shatter chariot and driver,\nwith you I shatter man and woman,\nwith you I shatter old man and youth,\nwith you I shatter young man and young woman,\nwith you I shatter shepherd and flock,\nwith you I shatter farmer and oxen,\nwith you I shatter governors and officials.\n“Before your eyes I will repay Babylon and all who live in Babylonia for all the wrong they have done in Zion,” declares the LORD.\n“I am against you, you destroying mountain,\nyou who destroy the whole earth,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“I will stretch out my hand against you,\nroll you off the cliffs,\nand make you a burned-out mountain.\nNo rock will be taken from you for a cornerstone,\nnor any stone for a foundation,\nfor you will be desolate forever,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n\n“Lift up a banner in the land!\nBlow the trumpet among the nations!\nPrepare the nations for battle against her;\nsummon against her these kingdoms:\nArarat, Minni and Ashkenaz.\nAppoint a commander against her;\nsend up horses like a swarm of locusts.\nPrepare the nations for battle against her—\nthe kings of the Medes,\ntheir governors and all their officials,\nand all the countries they rule.\nThe land trembles and writhes,\nfor the LORD’s purposes against Babylon stand—\nto lay waste the land of Babylon\nso that no one will live there.\nBabylon’s warriors have stopped fighting;\nthey remain in their strongholds.\nTheir strength is exhausted;\nthey have become weaklings.\nHer dwellings are set on fire;\nthe bars of her gates are broken.\nOne courier follows another\nand messenger follows messenger\nto announce to the king of Babylon\nthat his entire city is captured,\nthe river crossings seized,\nthe marshes set on fire,\nand the soldiers terrified.”\nThis is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says:\n“Daughter Babylon is like a threshing floor\nat the time it is trampled;\nthe time to harvest her will soon come.”\n\n“Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has devoured us,\nhe has thrown us into confusion,\nhe has made us an empty jar.\nLike a serpent he has swallowed us\nand filled his stomach with our delicacies,\nand then has spewed us out.\nMay the violence done to our flesh be on Babylon,”\nsay the inhabitants of Zion.\n“May our blood be on those who live in Babylonia,”\nsays Jerusalem.\nTherefore this is what the LORD says:\n“See, I will defend your cause\nand avenge you;\nI will dry up her sea\nand make her springs dry.\nBabylon will be a heap of ruins,\na haunt of jackals,\nan object of horror and scorn,\na place where no one lives.\nHer people all roar like young lions,\nthey growl like lion cubs.\nBut while they are aroused,\nI will set out a feast for them\nand make them drunk,\nso that they shout with laughter—\nthen sleep forever and not awake,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“I will bring them down\nlike lambs to the slaughter,\nlike rams and goats.\n\n“How Sheshak will be captured,\nthe boast of the whole earth seized!\nHow desolate Babylon will be\namong the nations!\nThe sea will rise over Babylon;\nits roaring waves will cover her.\nHer towns will be desolate,\na dry and desert land,\na land where no one lives,\nthrough which no one travels.\nI will punish Bel in Babylon\nand make him spew out what he has swallowed.\nThe nations will no longer stream to him.\nAnd the wall of Babylon will fall.\n\n“Come out of her, my people!\nRun for your lives!\nRun from the fierce anger of the LORD.\nDo not lose heart or be afraid\nwhen rumors are heard in the land;\none rumor comes this year, another the next,\nrumors of violence in the land\nand of ruler against ruler.\nFor the time will surely come\nwhen I will punish the idols of Babylon;\nher whole land will be disgraced\nand her slain will all lie fallen within her.\nThen heaven and earth and all that is in them\nwill shout for joy over Babylon,\nfor out of the north\ndestroyers will attack her,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n\n“Babylon must fall because of Israel’s slain,\njust as the slain in all the earth\nhave fallen because of Babylon.\nYou who have escaped the sword,\nleave and do not linger!\nRemember the LORD in a distant land,\nand call to mind Jerusalem.”\n\n“We are disgraced,\nfor we have been insulted\nand shame covers our faces,\nbecause foreigners have entered\nthe holy places of the LORD’s house.”\n\n“But days are coming,” declares the LORD,\n“when I will punish her idols,\nand throughout her land\nthe wounded will groan.\nEven if Babylon ascends to the heavens\nand fortifies her lofty stronghold,\nI will send destroyers against her,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n\n“The sound of a cry comes from Babylon,\nthe sound of great destruction\nfrom the land of the Babylonians.\nThe LORD will destroy Babylon;\nhe will silence her noisy din.\nWaves of enemies will rage like great waters;\nthe roar of their voices will resound.\nA destroyer will come against Babylon;\nher warriors will be captured,\nand their bows will be broken.\nFor the LORD is a God of retribution;\nhe will repay in full.\nI will make her officials and wise men drunk,\nher governors, officers and warriors as well;\nthey will sleep forever and not awake,”\ndeclares the King, whose name is the LORD Almighty.\nThis is what the LORD Almighty says:\n“Babylon’s thick wall will be leveled\nand her high gates set on fire;\nthe peoples exhaust themselves for nothing,\nthe nations’ labor is only fuel for the flames.”\nThis is the message Jeremiah the prophet gave to the staff officer Seraiah son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went to Babylon with Zedekiah king of Judah in the fourth year of his reign. Jeremiah had written on a scroll about all the disasters that would come upon Babylon—all that had been recorded concerning Babylon. He said to Seraiah, “When you get to Babylon, see that you read all these words aloud. Then say, ‘LORD, you have said you will destroy this place, so that neither people nor animals will live in it; it will be desolate forever.’ When you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates. Then say, ‘So will Babylon sink to rise no more because of the disaster I will bring on her. And her people will fall.’ ”\n\nThe words of Jeremiah end here.",

      "chapter_text": "Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah. He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, just as Jehoiakim had done. It was because of the LORD’s anger that all this happened to Jerusalem and Judah, and in the end he thrust them from his presence.\nNow Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.\nSo in the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army. They encamped outside the city and built siege works all around it. The city was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.\nBy the ninth day of the fourth month the famine in the city had become so severe that there was no food for the people to eat. Then the city wall was broken through, and the whole army fled. They left the city at night through the gate between the two walls near the king’s garden, though the Babylonians were surrounding the city. They fled toward the Arabah, but the Babylonian army pursued King Zedekiah and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his soldiers were separated from him and scattered, and he was captured.\nHe was taken to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced sentence on him. There at Riblah the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; he also killed all the officials of Judah. Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon, where he put him in prison till the day of his death.\nOn the tenth day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard, who served the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. He set fire to the temple of the LORD, the royal palace and all the houses of Jerusalem. Every important building he burned down. The whole Babylonian army, under the commander of the imperial guard, broke down all the walls around Jerusalem. Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard carried into exile some of the poorest people and those who remained in the city, along with the rest of the craftsmen and those who had deserted to the king of Babylon. But Nebuzaradan left behind the rest of the poorest people of the land to work the vineyards and fields.\nThe Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars, the movable stands and the bronze Sea that were at the temple of the LORD and they carried all the bronze to Babylon. They also took away the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and all the bronze articles used in the temple service. The commander of the imperial guard took away the basins, censers, sprinkling bowls, pots, lampstands, dishes and bowls used for drink offerings—all that were made of pure gold or silver.\nThe bronze from the two pillars, the Sea and the twelve bronze bulls under it, and the movable stands, which King Solomon had made for the temple of the LORD, was more than could be weighed. Each pillar was eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference; each was four fingers thick, and hollow. The bronze capital on top of one pillar was five cubits high and was decorated with a network and pomegranates of bronze all around. The other pillar, with its pomegranates, was similar. There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; the total number of pomegranates above the surrounding network was a hundred.\nThe commander of the guard took as prisoners Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank and the three doorkeepers. Of those still in the city, he took the officer in charge of the fighting men, and seven royal advisers. He also took the secretary who was chief officer in charge of conscripting the people of the land, sixty of whom were found in the city. Nebuzaradan the commander took them all and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. There at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king had them executed.\nSo Judah went into captivity, away from her land. This is the number of the people Nebuchadnezzar carried into exile:\n\nin the seventh year,\n3,023 Jews;\nin Nebuchadnezzar’s eighteenth year,\n832 people from Jerusalem;\nin his twenty-third year,\n745 Jews taken into exile by Nebuzaradan the commander of the imperial guard.\nThere were 4,600 people in all.\n\nIn the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the year Awel-Marduk became king of Babylon, on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, he released Jehoiachin king of Judah and freed him from prison. He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat of honor higher than those of the other kings who were with him in Babylon. So Jehoiachin put aside his prison clothes and for the rest of his life ate regularly at the king’s table. Day by day the king of Babylon gave Jehoiachin a regular allowance as long as he lived, till the day of his death.",
