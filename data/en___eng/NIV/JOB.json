      "chapter_text": "Intro\nThe wisdom of Proverbs describes how godly character generally leads to success. Ecclesiastes tempers this, warning that rewards are not guaranteed, since a kind of “crookedness” has come into our world. The book of Job goes further, exploring how righteous people sometimes suffer. The book of Job uses a common literary device from the wisdom traditions of the ancient world: an extended conversation based on poetic speeches.\nJob is introduced as a good man. But “the adversary” ( satan in Hebrew) points out an apparent problem in God’s moral oversight of the universe. If goodness is always rewarded, how can we know if it’s born from love of God or desire for gain? So God allows the adversary to bring suffering into Job’s life.\nJob doesn’t curse God as the adversary predicted but ends up debating with three friends: Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar. Their overly rigid view of the moral universe convinces them that Job’s own wrongdoing has caused his suffering. A young man Elihu joins the conversation later, while Job continues to insist that he has done nothing wrong and deserves a hearing before God.\nFinally, God reveals the power and wisdom shown in his oversight of creation. Job then humbly admits his own limited understanding. When God rebukes Job’s three friends, we see they are guilty of a far worse assumption than Job. In the end God blesses Job with twice as much as he had before. The book warns us to avoid reducing God’s moral rule to easy formulas.",

      "chapter_text": "In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil. He had seven sons and three daughters, and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.\nHis sons used to hold feasts in their homes on their birthdays, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would make arrangements for them to be purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular custom.\nOne day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them. The LORD said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”\nSatan answered the LORD, “From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.”\nThen the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil.”\n“Does Job fear God for nothing?” Satan replied. “Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land. But now stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face.”\nThe LORD said to Satan, “Very well, then, everything he has is in your power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger.”\nThen Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.\nOne day when Job’s sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother’s house, a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby, and the Sabeans attacked and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”\nWhile he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, “The fire of God fell from the heavens and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”\nWhile he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”\nWhile he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, “Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother’s house, when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!”\nAt this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship and said:\n“Naked I came from my mother’s womb,\nand naked I will depart.\nThe LORD gave and the LORD has taken away;\nmay the name of the LORD be praised.”\nIn all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.",

There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason.”\n“Skin for skin!” Satan replied. “A man will give all he has for his own life. But now stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face.”\nThe LORD said to Satan, “Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life.”\nSo Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head. Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.\nHis wife said to him, “Are you still maintaining your integrity? Curse God and die!”\nHe replied, “You are talking like a foolish woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?”\nIn all this, Job did not sin in what he said.\n\nWhen Job’s three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him. When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads. Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was.",

But when he saw that the three men had nothing more to say, his anger was aroused.\nSo Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said:\n“I am young in years,\nand you are old;\nthat is why I was fearful,\nnot daring to tell you what I know.\nI thought, ‘Age should speak;\nadvanced years should teach wisdom.’\nBut it is the spirit in a person,\nthe breath of the Almighty, that gives them understanding.\nIt is not only the old who are wise,\nnot only the aged who understand what is right.\n\n“Therefore I say: Listen to me;\nI too will tell you what I know.\nI waited while you spoke,\nI listened to your reasoning;\nwhile you were searching for words,\nI gave you my full attention.\nBut not one of you has proved Job wrong;\nnone of you has answered his arguments.\nDo not say, ‘We have found wisdom;\nlet God, not a man, refute him.’\nBut Job has not marshaled his words against me,\nand I will not answer him with your arguments.\n\n“They are dismayed and have no more to say;\nwords have failed them.\nMust I wait, now that they are silent,\nnow that they stand there with no reply?\nI too will have my say;\nI too will tell what I know.\nFor I am full of words,\nand the spirit within me compels me;\ninside I am like bottled-up wine,\nlike new wineskins ready to burst.\nI must speak and find relief;\nI must open my lips and reply.\nI will show no partiality,\nnor will I flatter anyone;\nfor if I were skilled in flattery,\nmy Maker would soon take me away.",

So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You have not spoken the truth about me, as my servant Job has.” So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what the LORD told them; and the LORD accepted Job’s prayer.\nAfter Job had prayed for his friends, the LORD restored his fortunes and gave him twice as much as he had before. All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the LORD had brought on him, and each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring.\nThe LORD blessed the latter part of Job’s life more than the former part. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys. And he also had seven sons and three daughters. The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah and the third Keren-Happuch. Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Job’s daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers.\nAfter this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation. And so Job died, an old man and full of years.",
