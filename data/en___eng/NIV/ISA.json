      "chapter_text": "Intro\nThe prophet Isaiah addressed the kingdom of Judah for forty years, beginning in the year that King Uzziah died (around 740 BC) and continuing at least to the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem in 701 BC. As with all the prophets, Isaiah based his message on the deep covenant bond between God and his people Israel. Prophets typically delivered their messages by composing oracles—poetic speeches they recited in public. Unlike some other prophets, Isaiah had personal access to the kings of his day. He was able to bring godly counsel to kings Ahaz and Hezekiah when the powerful Assyrian Empire threatened the life of the nation. Isaiah maintains an international perspective throughout his book, revealing that Israel’s life is bound up with the affairs of the broader world.\nIsaiah urges the people to care for the poor and needy, commit to follow God’s ways, and pursue social and economic justice. In typical prophetic pattern, he speaks of coming judgment because of Israel’s failure, but also of promised restoration, and moving from Israel to the wider world. God’s correction is in the service of renewal. Isaiah’s later oracles introduce the complex figure of the servant, whose personal sacrifice brings healing. These “servant songs” fit into the bigger picture of Israel’s return from exile, the LORD’s return to his people, and the nations turning to God. New Testament writers will turn to Isaiah often to explain how Israel’s ancient commission to bring blessing to the world was fulfilled.",

And they were calling to one another:\n“Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty;\nthe whole earth is full of his glory.”\nAt the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the temple was filled with smoke.\n“Woe to me!” I cried. “I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the LORD Almighty.”\nThen one of the seraphim flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar. With it he touched my mouth and said, “See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for.”\nThen I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?”\nAnd I said, “Here am I.

Say to him, ‘Be careful, keep calm and don’t be afraid. Do not lose heart because of these two smoldering stubs of firewood—because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah. Aram, Ephraim and Remaliah’s son have plotted your ruin, saying, “Let us invade Judah; let us tear it apart and divide it among ourselves, and make the son of Tabeel king over it.” Yet this is what the Sovereign LORD says:\n“ ‘It will not take place,\nit will not happen,\nfor the head of Aram is Damascus,\nand the head of Damascus is only Rezin.\nWithin sixty-five years\nEphraim will be too shattered to be a people.\nThe head of Ephraim is Samaria,\nand the head of Samaria is only Remaliah’s son.\nIf you do not stand firm in your faith,\nyou will not stand at all.’ ”\nAgain the LORD spoke to Ahaz, “Ask the LORD your God for a sign, whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heights.”\nBut Ahaz said, “I will not ask; I will not put the LORD to the test.”\nThen Isaiah said, “Hear now, you house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of humans? Will you try the patience of my God also? Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel. He will be eating curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, for before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste. The LORD will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your father a time unlike any since Ephraim broke away from Judah—he will bring the king of Assyria.”\nLORD\nIn that day the LORD will whistle for flies from the Nile delta in Egypt and for bees from the land of Assyria. They will all come and settle in the steep ravines and in the crevices in the rocks, on all the thornbushes and at all the water holes. In that day the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the Euphrates River—the king of Assyria—to shave your heads and private parts, and to cut off your beards also. In that day, a person will keep alive a young cow and two goats. And because of the abundance of the milk they give, there will be curds to eat. All who remain in the land will eat curds and honey. In that day, in every place where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels, there will be only briers and thorns. Hunters will go there with bow and arrow, for the land will be covered with briers and thorns.

For before the boy knows how to say ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria.”\nThe LORD spoke to me again:\n“Because this people has rejected\nthe gently flowing waters of Shiloah\nand rejoices over Rezin\nand the son of Remaliah,\ntherefore the Lord is about to bring against them\nthe mighty floodwaters of the Euphrates—\nthe king of Assyria with all his pomp.\nIt will overflow all its channels,\nrun over all its banks\nand sweep on into Judah, swirling over it,\npassing through it and reaching up to the neck.\nIts outspread wings will cover the breadth of your land,\nImmanuel!”\n\nRaise the war cry, you nations, and be shattered!\nListen, all you distant lands.\nPrepare for battle, and be shattered!\nPrepare for battle, and be shattered!\nDevise your strategy, but it will be thwarted;\npropose your plan, but it will not stand,\nfor God is with us.\nThis is what the LORD says to me with his strong hand upon me, warning me not to follow the way of this people:\n“Do not call conspiracy\neverything this people calls a conspiracy;\ndo not fear what they fear,\nand do not dread it.\nThe LORD Almighty is the one you are to regard as holy,\nhe is the one you are to fear,\nhe is the one you are to dread.\nHe will be a holy place;\nfor both Israel and Judah he will be\na stone that causes people to stumble\nand a rock that makes them fall.\nAnd for the people of Jerusalem he will be\na trap and a snare.\nMany of them will stumble;\nthey will fall and be broken,\nthey will be snared and captured.”\n\nBind up this testimony of warning\nand seal up God’s instruction among my disciples.\nI will wait for the LORD,\nwho is hiding his face from the descendants of Jacob.\nI will put my trust in him.\nHere am I, and the children the LORD has given me. We are signs and symbols in Israel from the LORD Almighty, who dwells on Mount Zion.\n\nWhen someone tells you to consult mediums and spiritists, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living? Consult God’s instruction and the testimony of warning. If anyone does not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn. Distressed and hungry, they will roam through the land; when they are famished, they will become enraged and, looking upward, will curse their king and their God. Then they will look toward the earth and see only distress and darkness and fearful gloom, and they will be thrust into utter darkness.",

Howl, you city!\nMelt away, all you Philistines!\nA cloud of smoke comes from the north,\nand there is not a straggler in its ranks.\nWhat answer shall be given\nto the envoys of that nation?\n“The LORD has established Zion,\nand in her his afflicted people will find refuge.”",

They will shudder with fear at the uplifted hand that the LORD Almighty raises against them. And the land of Judah will bring terror to the Egyptians; everyone to whom Judah is mentioned will be terrified, because of what the LORD Almighty is planning against them.\nIn that day five cities in Egypt will speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the LORD Almighty. One of them will be called the City of the Sun.\nIn that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the heart of Egypt, and a monument to the LORD at its border. It will be a sign and witness to the LORD Almighty in the land of Egypt. When they cry out to the LORD because of their oppressors, he will send them a savior and defender, and he will rescue them. So the LORD will make himself known to the Egyptians, and in that day they will acknowledge the LORD. They will worship with sacrifices and grain offerings; they will make vows to the LORD and keep them. The LORD will strike Egypt with a plague; he will strike them and heal them. They will turn to the LORD, and he will respond to their pleas and heal them.\nIn that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. In that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing on the earth. The LORD Almighty will bless them, saying, “Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance.”",

I will clothe him with your robe and fasten your sash around him and hand your authority over to him. He will be a father to those who live in Jerusalem and to the people of Judah. I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David; what he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open. I will drive him like a peg into a firm place; he will become a seat of honor for the house of his father. All the glory of his family will hang on him: its offspring and offshoots—all its lesser vessels, from the bowls to all the jars.\n“In that day,” declares the LORD Almighty, “the peg driven into the firm place will give way; it will be sheared off and will fall, and the load hanging on it will be cut down.” The LORD has spoken.",

She will return to her lucrative prostitution and will ply her trade with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.

Who will know?”\nYou turn things upside down,\nas if the potter were thought to be like the clay!\nShall what is formed say to the one who formed it,\n“You did not make me”?\nCan the pot say to the potter,\n“You know nothing”?\n\nIn a very short time, will not Lebanon be turned into a fertile field\nand the fertile field seem like a forest?\nIn that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll,\nand out of gloom and darkness\nthe eyes of the blind will see.\nOnce more the humble will rejoice in the LORD;\nthe needy will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.\nThe ruthless will vanish,\nthe mockers will disappear,\nand all who have an eye for evil will be cut down—\nthose who with a word make someone out to be guilty,\nwho ensnare the defender in court\nand with false testimony deprive the innocent of justice.\nTherefore this is what the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, says to the descendants of Jacob:\n“No longer will Jacob be ashamed;\nno longer will their faces grow pale.\nWhen they see among them their children,\nthe work of my hands,\nthey will keep my name holy;\nthey will acknowledge the holiness of the Holy One of Jacob,\nand will stand in awe of the God of Israel.\nThose who are wayward in spirit will gain understanding;\nthose who complain will accept instruction.”",

How gracious he will be when you cry for help! As soon as he hears, he will answer you. Although the Lord gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, your teachers will be hidden no more; with your own eyes you will see them. Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, “This is the way; walk in it.” Then you will desecrate your idols overlaid with silver and your images covered with gold; you will throw them away like a menstrual cloth and say to them, “Away with you!”\n\nHe will also send you rain for the seed you sow in the ground, and the food that comes from the land will be rich and plentiful. In that day your cattle will graze in broad meadows. The oxen and donkeys that work the soil will eat fodder and mash, spread out with fork and shovel. In the day of great slaughter, when the towers fall, streams of water will flow on every high mountain and every lofty hill. The moon will shine like the sun, and the sunlight will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven full days, when the LORD binds up the bruises of his people and heals the wounds he inflicted.\nSee, the Name of the LORD comes from afar,\nwith burning anger and dense clouds of smoke;\nhis lips are full of wrath,\nand his tongue is a consuming fire.\nHis breath is like a rushing torrent,\nrising up to the neck.\nHe shakes the nations in the sieve of destruction;\nhe places in the jaws of the peoples\na bit that leads them astray.\nAnd you will sing\nas on the night you celebrate a holy festival;\nyour hearts will rejoice\nas when people playing pipes go up\nto the mountain of the LORD,\nto the Rock of Israel.\nThe LORD will cause people to hear his majestic voice\nand will make them see his arm coming down\nwith raging anger and consuming fire,\nwith cloudburst, thunderstorm and hail.\nThe voice of the LORD will shatter Assyria;\nwith his rod he will strike them down.\nEvery stroke the LORD lays on them\nwith his punishing club\nwill be to the music of timbrels and harps,\nas he fights them in battle with the blows of his arm.\nTopheth has long been prepared;\nit has been made ready for the king.\nIts fire pit has been made deep and wide,\nwith an abundance of fire and wood;\nthe breath of the LORD,\nlike a stream of burning sulfur,\nsets it ablaze.",

Then the king of Assyria sent his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. When the commander stopped at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field, Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to him.\nThe field commander said to them, “Tell Hezekiah:\n“ ‘This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: On what are you basing this confidence of yours? You say you have counsel and might for war—but you speak only empty words. On whom are you depending, that you rebel against me? Look, I know you are depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces the hand of anyone who leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him. But if you say to me, “We are depending on the LORD our God”—isn’t he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, “You must worship before this altar”?\n“ ‘Come now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses—if you can put riders on them! How then can you repulse one officer of the least of my master’s officials, even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen? Furthermore, have I come to attack and destroy this land without the LORD? The LORD himself told me to march against this country and destroy it.’ ”\nThen Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to the field commander, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don’t speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall.”\nBut the commander replied, “Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things, and not to the people sitting on the wall—who, like you, will have to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine?”\nThen the commander stood and called out in Hebrew, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria! This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you! Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the LORD when he says, ‘The LORD will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.’\n“Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then each of you will eat fruit from your own vine and fig tree and drink water from your own cistern, until I come and take you to a land like your own—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.\n“Do not let Hezekiah mislead you when he says, ‘The LORD will deliver us.’ Have the gods of any nations ever delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Assyria? Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand? Who of all the gods of these countries have been able to save their lands from me? How then can the LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?”\nBut the people remained silent and said nothing in reply, because the king had commanded, “Do not answer him.”\nThen Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to Hezekiah, with their clothes torn, and told him what the field commander had said.",

      "chapter_text": "When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the LORD. He sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. They told him, “This is what Hezekiah says: This day is a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace, as when children come to the moment of birth and there is no strength to deliver them. It may be that the LORD your God will hear the words of the field commander, whom his master, the king of Assyria, has sent to ridicule the living God, and that he will rebuke him for the words the LORD your God has heard. Therefore pray for the remnant that still survives.”\nWhen King Hezekiah’s officials came to Isaiah, Isaiah said to them, “Tell your master, ‘This is what the LORD says: Do not be afraid of what you have heard—those words with which the underlings of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. Listen! When he hears a certain report, I will make him want to return to his own country, and there I will have him cut down with the sword.’ ”\nWhen the field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah.\nNow Sennacherib received a report that Tirhakah, the king of Cush, was marching out to fight against him. When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah with this word: “Say to Hezekiah king of Judah: Do not let the god you depend on deceive you when he says, ‘Jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of Assyria.’ Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries, destroying them completely. And will you be delivered? Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my predecessors deliver them—the gods of Gozan, Harran, Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar? Where is the king of Hamath or the king of Arpad? Where are the kings of Lair, Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah?”\n\nHezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the temple of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD. And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD: “LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth. Give ear, LORD, and hear; open your eyes, LORD, and see; listen to all the words Sennacherib has sent to ridicule the living God.\n“It is true, LORD, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste all these peoples and their lands. They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods but only wood and stone, fashioned by human hands. Now, LORD our God, deliver us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, LORD, are the only God.”\n\nThen Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria, this is the word the LORD has spoken against him:\n“Virgin Daughter Zion\ndespises and mocks you.\nDaughter Jerusalem\ntosses her head as you flee.\nWho is it you have ridiculed and blasphemed?\nAgainst whom have you raised your voice\nand lifted your eyes in pride?\nAgainst the Holy One of Israel!\nBy your messengers\nyou have ridiculed the Lord.\nAnd you have said,\n‘With my many chariots\nI have ascended the heights of the mountains,\nthe utmost heights of Lebanon.\nI have cut down its tallest cedars,\nthe choicest of its junipers.\nI have reached its remotest heights,\nthe finest of its forests.\nI have dug wells in foreign lands\nand drunk the water there.\nWith the soles of my feet\nI have dried up all the streams of Egypt.’\n\n“Have you not heard?\nLong ago I ordained it.\nIn days of old I planned it;\nnow I have brought it to pass,\nthat you have turned fortified cities\ninto piles of stone.\nTheir people, drained of power,\nare dismayed and put to shame.\nThey are like plants in the field,\nlike tender green shoots,\nlike grass sprouting on the roof,\nscorched before it grows up.\n\n“But I know where you are\nand when you come and go\nand how you rage against me.\nBecause you rage against me\nand because your insolence has reached my ears,\nI will put my hook in your nose\nand my bit in your mouth,\nand I will make you return\nby the way you came.\n“This will be the sign for you, Hezekiah:\n“This year you will eat what grows by itself,\nand the second year what springs from that.\nBut in the third year sow and reap,\nplant vineyards and eat their fruit.\nOnce more a remnant of the kingdom of Judah\nwill take root below and bear fruit above.\nFor out of Jerusalem will come a remnant,\nand out of Mount Zion a band of survivors.\nThe zeal of the LORD Almighty\nwill accomplish this.\n“Therefore this is what the LORD says concerning the king of Assyria:\n“He will not enter this city\nor shoot an arrow here.\nHe will not come before it with shield\nor build a siege ramp against it.\nBy the way that he came he will return;\nhe will not enter this city,”\ndeclares the LORD.\n“I will defend this city and save it,\nfor my sake and for the sake of David my servant!”\nThen the angel of the LORD went out and put to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the next morning—there were all the dead bodies! So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.\nOne day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisrok, his sons Adrammelek and Sharezer killed him with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king.",

The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him and said, “This is what the LORD says: Put your house in order, because you are going to die; you will not recover.”\nHezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD, “Remember, LORD, how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.\nThen the word of the LORD came to Isaiah: “Go and tell Hezekiah, ‘This is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will add fifteen years to your life. And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city.\n“ ‘This is the LORD’s sign to you that the LORD will do what he has promised: I will make the shadow cast by the sun go back the ten steps it has gone down on the stairway of Ahaz.’ ” So the sunlight went back the ten steps it had gone down.\n\nA writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery:\nI said, “In the prime of my life\nmust I go through the gates of death\nand be robbed of the rest of my years?”\nI said, “I will not again see the LORD himself\nin the land of the living;\nno longer will I look on my fellow man,\nor be with those who now dwell in this world.\nLike a shepherd’s tent my house\nhas been pulled down and taken from me.\nLike a weaver I have rolled up my life,\nand he has cut me off from the loom;\nday and night you made an end of me.\nI waited patiently till dawn,\nbut like a lion he broke all my bones;\nday and night you made an end of me.\nI cried like a swift or thrush,\nI moaned like a mourning dove.\nMy eyes grew weak as I looked to the heavens.\nI am being threatened; Lord, come to my aid!”\n\nBut what can I say?\nHe has spoken to me, and he himself has done this.\nI will walk humbly all my years\nbecause of this anguish of my soul.\nLord, by such things people live;\nand my spirit finds life in them too.\nYou restored me to health\nand let me live.\nSurely it was for my benefit\nthat I suffered such anguish.\nIn your love you kept me\nfrom the pit of destruction;\nyou have put all my sins\nbehind your back.\nFor the grave cannot praise you,\ndeath cannot sing your praise;\nthose who go down to the pit\ncannot hope for your faithfulness.\nThe living, the living—they praise you,\nas I am doing today;\nparents tell their children\nabout your faithfulness.\n\nThe LORD will save me,\nand we will sing with stringed instruments\nall the days of our lives\nin the temple of the LORD.\nIsaiah had said, “Prepare a poultice of figs and apply it to the boil, and he will recover.”\nHezekiah had asked, “What will be the sign that I will go up to the temple of the LORD?”",

They will proclaim my glory among the nations. And they will bring all your people, from all the nations, to my holy mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the LORD—on horses, in chariots and wagons, and on mules and camels,” says the LORD. “They will bring them, as the Israelites bring their grain offerings, to the temple of the LORD in ceremonially clean vessels.

From one New Moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come and bow down before me,” says the LORD. “And they will go out and look on the dead bodies of those who rebelled against me; the worms that eat them will not die, the fire that burns them will not be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind.”",
