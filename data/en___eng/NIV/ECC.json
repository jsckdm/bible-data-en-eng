      "chapter_text": "Intro\nEcclesiastes is the collected words of a “teacher” or “preacher.” The Teacher is described as having been king over Israel in Jerusalem, and as the son of David. Both of these mean that he was in the royal line of Judah. He is not further identified, and while tradition identifies him with Solomon, it is appropriate to leave this cloak of anonymity in place.\nThe repeated phrase Meaningless! Meaningless! Everything is meaningless! warns us that life’s rewards are uncertain and ultimately unsatisfying. The Teacher pursues this insight in a long discourse that shifts between prose and poetry, and between autobiography and straightforward teaching. The book makes observations and poses questions, returning to themes like the wind— round and round it goes, ever returning on its course.\nWhen the Teacher says What is crooked cannot be straightened, he reminds us that something wrong has intruded into our world. This fits the larger Jewish story told in the rest of the Scriptures. Setting things right again is what this bigger drama is about. The Teacher, however, does not tell us about God’s attempts at straightening the world. He is content to say that God is sovereign over all things and it is our duty to follow his ways for living, since God will bring every deed into judgment.",

I applied my mind to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under the heavens. What a heavy burden God has laid on mankind! I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.\nWhat is crooked cannot be straightened;\nwhat is lacking cannot be counted.\nI said to myself, “Look, I have increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge.” Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind.\nFor with much wisdom comes much sorrow;\nthe more knowledge, the more grief.",

      "chapter_text": "I said to myself, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good.” But that also proved to be meaningless. “Laughter,” I said, “is madness. And what does pleasure accomplish?” I tried cheering myself with wine, and embracing folly—my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was good for people to do under the heavens during the few days of their lives.\nI undertook great projects: I built houses for myself and planted vineyards. I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them. I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees. I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me. I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired male and female singers, and a harem as well—the delights of a man’s heart. I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with me.\nI denied myself nothing my eyes desired;\nI refused my heart no pleasure.\nMy heart took delight in all my labor,\nand this was the reward for all my toil.\nYet when I surveyed all that my hands had done\nand what I had toiled to achieve,\neverything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind;\nnothing was gained under the sun.\n\nThen I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom,\nand also madness and folly.\nWhat more can the king’s successor do\nthan what has already been done?\nI saw that wisdom is better than folly,\njust as light is better than darkness.\nThe wise have eyes in their heads,\nwhile the fool walks in the darkness;\nbut I came to realize\nthat the same fate overtakes them both.\nThen I said to myself,\n“The fate of the fool will overtake me also.\nWhat then do I gain by being wise?”\nI said to myself,\n“This too is meaningless.”\nFor the wise, like the fool, will not be long remembered;\nthe days have already come when both have been forgotten.\nLike the fool, the wise too must die!\n\nSo I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind. I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me. And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless. So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun. For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then they must leave all they own to another who has not toiled for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune. What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun? All their days their work is grief and pain; even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless.\nA person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God, for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment? To the person who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.",

I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it.

Surely the fate of human beings is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath; humans have no advantage over animals. Everything is meaningless. All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return.

The hearts of people, moreover, are full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live, and afterward they join the dead. Anyone who is among the living has hope—even a live dog is better off than a dead lion!\nFor the living know that they will die,\nbut the dead know nothing;\nthey have no further reward,\nand even their name is forgotten.\nTheir love, their hate\nand their jealousy have long since vanished;\nnever again will they have a part\nin anything that happens under the sun.\nGo, eat your food with gladness, and drink your wine with a joyful heart, for God has already approved what you do. Always be clothed in white, and always anoint your head with oil. Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love, all the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun—all your meaningless days. For this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labor under the sun. Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the realm of the dead, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.\nI have seen something else under the sun:\nThe race is not to the swift\nor the battle to the strong,\nnor does food come to the wise\nor wealth to the brilliant\nor favor to the learned;\nbut time and chance happen to them all.\nMoreover, no one knows when their hour will come:\nAs fish are caught in a cruel net,\nor birds are taken in a snare,\nso people are trapped by evil times\nthat fall unexpectedly upon them.\n\nI also saw under the sun this example of wisdom that greatly impressed me: There was once a small city with only a few people in it. And a powerful king came against it, surrounded it and built huge siege works against it. Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered that poor man. So I said, “Wisdom is better than strength.” But the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are no longer heeded.\nThe quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded\nthan the shouts of a ruler of fools.\nWisdom is better than weapons of war,\nbut one sinner destroys much good.",
