It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the exile of Jerusalem in the fifth month.\nNow the word of the LORD came to me, saying,\n“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,\nAnd before you were born I consecrated you;\nI have appointed you as a prophet to the nations.”\nThen I said, “Oh, Lord GOD!\nBehold, I do not know how to speak,\nBecause I am a youth.”\nBut the LORD said to me,\n“Do not say, ‘I am a youth,’\nBecause everywhere I send you, you shall go,\nAnd all that I command you, you shall speak.\n“Do not be afraid of them,\nFor I am with you to save you,” declares the LORD.\nThen the LORD stretched out His hand and touched my mouth, and the LORD said to me,\n“Behold, I have put My words in your mouth.\n“See, I have appointed you this day over the nations and over the kingdoms,\nTo root out and to tear down,\nTo destroy and to overthrow,\nTo build and to plant.”\n\nAnd the word of the LORD came to me, saying, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” And I said, “I see a branch of an almond tree.” Then the LORD said to me, “You have seen well, for I am watching over My word to perform it.”\nAnd the word of the LORD came to me a second time, saying, “What do you see?” And I said, “I see a boiling pot, facing away from the north.” Then the LORD said to me, “Out of the north the evil will be unleashed on all the inhabitants of the land. For, behold, I am calling all the families of the kingdoms of the north,” declares the LORD; “and they will come and place, each one of them, his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its walls around, and against all the cities of Judah. And I will pronounce My judgments against them concerning all their wickedness, since they have abandoned Me and have offered sacrifices to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands. Now, belt your garment around your waist and arise, and speak to them all that I command you. Do not be dismayed before them, or I will make you dismayed before them. Now behold, I have made you today like a fortified city and like a pillar of iron and walls of bronze against the whole land, to the kings of Judah, to its leaders, to its priests, and to the people of the land. And they will fight against you but they will not overcome you, for I am with you to save you,” declares the LORD.",

      "chapter_text": "Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying, “Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, ‘This is what the LORD says:\n“I remember regarding you the devotion of your youth,\nYour love when you were a bride,\nYour following after Me in the wilderness,\nThrough a land not sown.\n“Israel was holy to the LORD,\nThe first of His harvest.\nAll who ate of it became guilty;\nEvil came upon them,” declares the LORD.’ ”\nHear the word of the LORD, house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel. This is what the LORD says:\n“What injustice did your fathers find in Me,\nThat they went far from Me,\nAnd walked after emptiness and became empty?\n“They did not say, ‘Where is the LORD\nWho brought us up out of the land of Egypt,\nWho led us through the wilderness,\nThrough a land of deserts and of pits,\nThrough a land of drought and of deep darkness,\nThrough a land that no one crossed\nAnd where no person lived?’\n“I brought you into the fruitful land\nTo eat its fruit and its good things.\nBut you came and defiled My land,\nAnd you made My inheritance an abomination.\n“The priests did not say, ‘Where is the LORD?’\nAnd those who handle the Law did not know Me;\nThe rulers also revolted against Me,\nAnd the prophets prophesied by Baal\nAnd walked after things that were of no benefit.\n¶“Therefore I will still contend with you,” declares the LORD,\n“And I will contend with your sons’ sons.\n“For cross to the coastlands of Kittim and see,\nAnd send to Kedar and observe closely,\nAnd see if there has been anything like this!\n“Has a nation changed gods,\nWhen they were not gods?\nBut My people have exchanged their glory\nFor that which is of no benefit.\n“Be appalled at this, you heavens,\nAnd shudder, be very desolate,” declares the LORD.\n“For My people have committed two evils:\nThey have abandoned Me,\nThe fountain of living waters,\nTo carve out for themselves cisterns,\nBroken cisterns\nThat do not hold water.\n¶“Is Israel a slave? Or is he a servant born in the home?\nWhy has he become plunder?\n“The young lions have roared at him,\nThey have roared loudly.\nAnd they have made his land a waste;\nHis cities have been destroyed, without inhabitant.\n“Also the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes\nHave shaved your head.\n“Have you not done this to yourself\nBy your abandoning the LORD your God\nWhen He led you in the way?\n“But now what are you doing on the road to Egypt,\nExcept to drink the waters of the Nile?\nOr what are you doing on the road to Assyria,\nExcept to drink the waters of the Euphrates River?\n“Your own wickedness will correct you,\nAnd your apostasies will punish you;\nKnow therefore and see that it is evil and bitter\nFor you to abandon the LORD your God,\nAnd the fear of Me is not in you,” declares the Lord GOD of armies.\n¶“For long ago I broke your yoke\nAnd tore off your restraints;\nBut you said, ‘I will not serve!’\nFor on every high hill\nAnd under every leafy tree\nYou have lain down as a prostitute.\n“Yet I planted you as a choice vine,\nA completely faithful seed.\nHow then have you turned yourself before Me\nInto the degenerate shoots of a foreign vine?\n“Although you wash yourself with lye\nAnd use much soap,\nThe stain of your guilt is before Me,” declares the Lord GOD.\n“How can you say, ‘I am not defiled,\nI have not gone after the Baals’?\nLook at your way in the valley!\nKnow what you have done!\nYou are a swift young camel running about senselessly on her ways,\nA wild donkey accustomed to the wilderness,\nThat sniffs the wind in her passion.\nWho can turn her away in her mating season?\nNone who seek her will grow weary;\nIn her month they will find her.\n“Keep your feet from being bare,\nAnd your throat from thirst;\nBut you said, ‘It is hopeless!\nNo! For I have loved strangers,\nAnd I will walk after them.’\n¶“Like the shame of a thief when he is discovered,\nSo the house of Israel is shamed;\nThey, their kings, their leaders,\nTheir priests, and their prophets,\nWho say to a tree, ‘You are my father,’\nAnd to a stone, ‘You gave me birth.’\nFor they have turned their backs to Me,\nAnd not their faces;\nBut in the time of their trouble they will say,\n‘Arise and save us!’\n“But where are your gods\nWhich you made for yourself?\nLet them arise, if they can save you\nIn the time of your trouble!\nFor as many as the number of your cities\nAre your gods, Judah.\n¶“Why do you contend with Me?\nYou have all revolted against Me,” declares the LORD.\n“In vain I have struck your sons;\nThey did not accept discipline.\nYour sword has devoured your prophets\nLike a destroying lion.\n“You generation, look to the word of the LORD.\nHave I been a wilderness to Israel,\nOr a land of thick darkness?\nWhy do My people say, ‘We are free to roam;\nWe will no longer come to You’?\n“Can a virgin forget her jewelry,\nOr a bride her attire?\nYet My people have forgotten Me\nFor days without number.\n“How well you prepare your way\nTo seek love!\nTherefore even to the wicked women\nYou have taught your ways.\n“Also on your skirts is found\nThe lifeblood of the innocent poor;\nYou did not find them breaking in.\nBut in spite of all these things,\nYou said, ‘I am innocent;\nSurely His anger is turned away from me.’\nBehold, I will enter into judgment with you\nBecause you say, ‘I have not sinned.’\n“Why do you go around so much\nChanging your way?\nAlso, you will be put to shame by Egypt,\nJust as you were put to shame by Assyria.\n“From this place as well you will go out\nWith your hands on your head;\nFor the LORD has rejected those in whom you trust,\nAnd you will not prosper with them.”",

She went up on every high hill and under every leafy tree, and she prostituted herself there. Yet I thought, ‘After she has done all these things she will return to Me’; but she did not return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it. And I saw that for all the adulteries of faithless Israel, I had sent her away and given her a certificate of divorce, yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear; but she went and prostituted herself also. And because of the thoughtlessness of her prostitution, she defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and trees. Yet in spite of all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to Me with all her heart, but rather in deception,” declares the LORD.\n\nAnd the LORD said to me, “Faithless Israel has proved herself to be more righteous than treacherous Judah. Go and proclaim these words toward the north and say,\n‘Return, faithless Israel,’ declares the LORD;\n‘I will not look at you in anger.\nFor I am gracious,’ declares the LORD;\n‘I will not be angry forever.\n‘Only acknowledge your wrongdoing,\nThat you have revolted against the LORD your God,\nAnd have scattered your favors to the strangers under every leafy tree,\nAnd you have not obeyed My voice,’ declares the LORD.\n‘Return, you faithless sons,’ declares the LORD;\n‘For I am a master to you,\nAnd I will take you, one from a city and two from a family,\nAnd bring you to Zion.’\n“Then I will give you shepherds after My own heart, who will feed you knowledge and understanding. And it shall be in those days when you become numerous and are fruitful in the land,” declares the LORD, “they will no longer say, ‘The ark of the covenant of the LORD.’ And it will not come to mind, nor will they remember it, nor miss it, nor will it be made again. At that time they will call Jerusalem ‘The Throne of the LORD,’ and all the nations will assemble at it, at Jerusalem, for the name of the LORD; and they will no longer follow the stubbornness of their evil heart. In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel, and they will come together from the land of the north to the land that I gave your fathers as an inheritance.\n“Then I said,\n‘How I would set you among My sons\nAnd give you a pleasant land,\nThe most beautiful inheritance of the nations!’\nAnd I said, ‘You shall call Me, My Father,\nAnd not turn away from following Me.’\n“However, as a woman treacherously leaves her lover,\nSo you have dealt treacherously with Me,\nHouse of Israel,” declares the LORD.\n¶A voice is heard on the bare heights,\nThe weeping, the pleading of the sons of Israel.\nBecause they have perverted their way,\nThey have forgotten the LORD their God.\n“Return, you faithless sons,\nI will heal your faithlessness.”\n“Behold, we come to You;\nFor You are the LORD our God.\n“Certainly the hills are a deception,\nCommotion on the mountains.\nCertainly in the LORD our God\nIs the salvation of Israel.\n“But the shame has consumed the product of our fathers’ labor since our youth—their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. Let us lie down in our shame, and let our humiliation cover us; for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day.

Surely You have utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, ‘You will have peace’; yet a sword touches the throat.”\nAt that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A scorching wind from the bare heights in the wilderness, in the direction of the daughter of My people—not to winnow and not to cleanse, a wind too strong for this—will come at My command; now I will also pronounce judgments against them.”\n“Behold, he goes up like clouds,\nAnd his chariots like the whirlwind;\nHis horses are swifter than eagles.\nWoe to us, for we are ruined!”\n¶Wash your heart from evil, Jerusalem,\nSo that you may be saved.\nHow long will your wicked thoughts\nLodge within you?\nFor a voice declares from Dan,\nAnd proclaims wickedness from Mount Ephraim.\n“Report it to the nations, now!\nProclaim to Jerusalem,\n‘Enemies are coming from a remote country,\nAnd they raise their voices against the cities of Judah.\n‘Like watchmen of a field they are against her all around,\nBecause she has rebelled against Me,’ declares the LORD.\n“Your ways and your deeds\nHave brought these things upon you.\nThis is your evil. How bitter!\nHow it has touched your heart!”\n\n¶My soul, my soul! I am in anguish! Oh, my heart!\nMy heart is pounding in me;\nI cannot keep silent,\nBecause, my soul, you have heard\nThe sound of the trumpet,\nThe alarm of war.\nDisaster upon disaster is proclaimed,\nFor the whole land is devastated;\nSuddenly my tents are devastated,\nAnd my curtains in an instant.\nHow long must I see the flag\nAnd hear the sound of the trumpet?\n“For My people are foolish,\nThey do not know Me;\nThey are foolish children\nAnd have no understanding.\nThey are skillful at doing evil,\nBut they do not know how to do good.”\n¶I looked at the earth, and behold, it was a formless and desolate emptiness;\nAnd to the heavens, and they had no light.\nI looked on the mountains, and behold, they were quaking,\nAnd all the hills jolted back and forth.\nI looked, and behold, there was no human,\nAnd all the birds of the sky had fled.\nI looked, and behold, the fruitful land was a wilderness,\nAnd all its cities were pulled down\nBefore the LORD, before His fierce anger.\n¶For this is what the LORD says:\n“The whole land shall be a desolation,\nYet I will not execute a complete destruction.\n“For this the earth will mourn,\nAnd the heavens above will become dark,\nBecause I have spoken, I have purposed,\nAnd I have not changed My mind, nor will I turn from it.”\nAt the sound of the horseman and archer every city flees;\nThey go into the thickets and climb among the rocks;\nEvery city is abandoned,\nAnd no one lives in them.\nAnd you, desolate one, what will you do?\nAlthough you dress in scarlet,\nAlthough you adorn yourself with jewelry of gold,\nAlthough you enlarge your eyes with makeup,\nIn vain you make yourself beautiful.\nYour lovers despise you;\nThey seek your life.\nFor I heard a voice cry as of a woman in labor,\nThe anguish as of one giving birth to her first child.\nThe voice of the daughter of Zion gasping for breath,\nStretching out her hands, saying,\n“Ah, woe to me, for I faint before murderers.”",

Do not trust in deceptive words, saying, ‘This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD.’ For if you truly amend your ways and your deeds, if you truly practice justice between a person and his neighbor, if you do not oppress the stranger, the orphan, or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place, nor follow other gods to your own ruin, then I will let you live in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers forever and ever.\n“Behold, you are trusting in deceptive words to no avail. Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, offer sacrifices to Baal, and follow other gods that you have not known, then come and stand before Me in this house which is called by My name, and say, ‘We are saved!’—so that you may do all these abominations? Has this house, which is called by My name, become a den of robbers in your sight? Behold, I Myself have seen it,” declares the LORD.\n“But go now to My place which was in Shiloh, where I made My name dwell at the beginning, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of My people Israel. And now, because you have done all these things,” declares the LORD, “and I spoke to you, speaking again and again, but you did not listen, and I called you but you did not answer, therefore I will do to the house which is called by My name, in which you trust, and to the place which I gave you and your fathers, just as I did to Shiloh. I will hurl you out of My sight, just as I have hurled out all your brothers, all the descendants of Ephraim.\n“As for you, do not pray for this people, and do not lift up a cry or prayer for them, and do not plead with Me; for I am not listening to you. Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? The children gather wood, the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough to make sacrificial cakes for the queen of heaven; and they pour out drink offerings to other gods in order to provoke Me to anger. Are they provoking Me?” declares the LORD. “Is it not themselves instead, to their own shame?” Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: “Behold, My anger and My wrath will be poured out on this place, on human and animal life, and on the trees of the field and the fruit of the ground; and it will burn and not be quenched.”\nThis is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: “Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat flesh. For I did not speak to your fathers, or command them on the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices. But this is what I commanded them, saying, ‘Obey My voice, and I will be your God, and you will be My people; and you shall walk entirely in the way which I command you, so that it may go well for you.’ Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked by their own advice and in the stubbornness of their evil hearts, and they went backward and not forward. Since the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have sent you all My servants the prophets, sending them daily, again and again. Yet they did not listen to Me or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck; they did more evil than their fathers.\n“So you shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you; and you shall call to them, but they will not answer you. And you shall say to them, ‘This is the nation that did not obey the voice of the LORD their God or accept discipline; trustworthiness has perished and has been eliminated from their mouth.\n‘Cut off your hair and throw it away,\nAnd take up a song of mourning on the bare heights;\nFor the LORD has rejected and forsaken\nThe generation of His wrath.’\nFor the sons of Judah have done that which is evil in My sight,” declares the LORD. “They have put their detestable things in the house which is called by My name, to defile it. They have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the Valley of Ben-hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command, and it did not come into My mind.\n“Therefore, behold, days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when it will no longer be called Topheth, or the Valley of Ben-hinnom, but the Valley of the Slaughter; for they will bury in Topheth because there is no other place. The dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth; and no one will frighten them away. Then I will eliminate from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the groom and the voice of the bride; for the land will become a site of ruins.",

And death will be chosen rather than life by all the remnant that remains of this evil family, that remains in all the places to which I have driven them,” declares the LORD of armies.\n“You shall say to them, ‘This is what the LORD says:\n“Do people fall and not get up?\nDoes one turn away and not repent?\n“Why has this people, Jerusalem,\nTurned away in continual apostasy?\nThey hold on to deceit,\nThey refuse to return.\n“I have listened and heard,\nThey have spoken what is not right;\nNo one repented of his wickedness,\nSaying, ‘What have I done?’\nEveryone turned to his own course,\nLike a horse charging into the battle.\n“Even the stork in the sky\nKnows her seasons;\nAnd the turtledove, the swallow, and the crane\nKeep to the time of their migration;\nBut My people do not know\nThe judgment of the LORD.\n¶“How can you say, ‘We are wise,\nAnd the Law of the LORD is with us’?\nBut behold, the lying pen of the scribes\nHas made it into a lie.\n“The wise men are put to shame,\nThey are dismayed and caught;\nBehold, they have rejected the word of the LORD,\nSo what kind of wisdom do they have?\n“Therefore I will give their wives to others,\nTheir fields to new owners;\nBecause from the least even to the greatest\nEveryone is greedy for gain;\nFrom the prophet even to the priest,\nEveryone practices deceit.\n“They have healed the brokenness of the daughter of My people superficially,\nSaying, ‘Peace, peace,’\nBut there is no peace.\n“Were they ashamed because of the abomination they had done?\nThey were not ashamed at all,\nAnd they did not know how to be ashamed;\nTherefore they will fall among those who fall;\nAt the time of their punishment they will collapse,”\nSays the LORD.\n¶“I will certainly snatch them away,” declares the LORD.\n“There will be no grapes on the vine\nAnd no figs on the fig tree,\nAnd the leaf will wither;\nAnd what I have given them will pass away.” ’ ”\nWhy are we sitting still?\nAssemble yourselves, and let’s go into the fortified cities\nAnd perish there,\nFor the LORD our God has doomed us\nAnd given us poisoned water to drink,\nBecause we have sinned against the LORD.\nWe waited for peace, but no good came;\nFor a time of healing, but behold, terror!\nFrom Dan there is heard the snorting of his horses;\nAt the sound of the neighing of his stallions\nThe whole land quakes;\nFor they come and devour the land and its fullness,\nThe city and its inhabitants.\n“For behold, I am sending serpents among you,\nVipers for which there is no charm;\nAnd they will bite you,” declares the LORD.\n¶My sorrow is beyond healing,\nMy heart is faint within me!\nBehold, listen! The cry of the daughter of my people from a distant land:\n“Is the LORD not in Zion? Is her King not within her?”\n“Why have they provoked Me with their carved images, with foreign idols?”\n“Harvest is past, summer is over,\nAnd we are not saved.”\nI am broken over the brokenness of the daughter of my people.\nI mourn, dismay has taken hold of me.\nIs there no balm in Gilead?\nIs there no physician there?\nWhy then has not the health of the daughter of my people been restored?",

And who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD has spoken, that he may declare it? Why is the land destroyed, laid waste like the desert, so that no one passes through? The LORD said, “Because they have abandoned My Law which I put before them, and have not obeyed My voice nor walked according to it, but have followed the stubbornness of their heart and the Baals, as their fathers taught them,” therefore this is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: “Behold, I will feed this people wormwood; and I will give them poisoned water to drink. I will also scatter them among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them until I have put an end to them.”\nThis is what the LORD of armies says:\n“Consider and call for the mourning women, that they may come;\nAnd send for the skillful women, that they may come!\n“Have them hurry and take up a wailing for us,\nSo that our eyes may shed tears,\nAnd our eyelids flow with water.\n“For a voice of wailing is heard from Zion:\n‘How devastated we are!\nWe are put to great shame,\nFor we have abandoned the land\nBecause they have torn down our homes.’ ”\nNow hear the word of the LORD, you women,\nAnd let your ears receive the word of His mouth;\nTeach your daughters wailing,\nAnd have every woman teach her neighbor a song of mourning.\nFor death has come up through our windows;\nIt has entered our palaces\nTo eliminate the children from the streets,\nThe young men from the public squares.\nSpeak, “This is what the LORD says:\n‘The corpses of people will fall like dung on the open field,\nAnd like the sheaf after the reaper,\nBut no one will gather them.’ ”\nThis is what the LORD says: “Let no wise man boast of his wisdom, nor let the mighty man boast of his might, nor a rich man boast of his riches; but let the one who boasts boast of this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am the LORD who exercises mercy, justice, and righteousness on the earth; for I delight in these things,” declares the LORD.\n“Behold, the days are coming,” declares the LORD, “that I will punish all who are circumcised and yet uncircumcised— Egypt, Judah, Edom, the sons of Ammon, Moab, and all those inhabiting the desert who trim the hair on their temples; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised of heart.”",

This is what the LORD says:\n“Do not learn the way of the nations,\nAnd do not be terrified by the signs of the heavens,\nAlthough the nations are terrified by them;\nFor the customs of the peoples are futile;\nFor it is wood cut from the forest,\nThe work of the hands of a craftsman with a cutting tool.\n“They decorate the idol with silver and gold;\nThey fasten it with nails and hammers\nSo that it will not totter.\n“They are like a scarecrow in a cucumber field,\nAnd they cannot speak;\nThey must be carried,\nBecause they cannot walk!\nDo not fear them,\nFor they can do no harm,\nNor can they do any good.”\n¶There is none like You, LORD;\nYou are great, and Your name is great in might.\nWho would not fear You, O King of the nations?\nFor it is Your due!\nFor among all the wise men of the nations\nAnd in all their kingdoms,\nThere is none like You.\nBut they are altogether stupid and foolish;\nThe instruction from idols is nothing but wood!\nBeaten silver is brought from Tarshish,\nAnd gold from Uphaz,\nThe work of a craftsman and of the hands of a goldsmith;\nTheir clothing is of violet and purple;\nThey are all the work of skilled people.\nBut the LORD is the true God;\nHe is the living God and the everlasting King.\nThe earth quakes at His wrath,\nAnd the nations cannot endure His indignation.\nThis is what you shall say to them: “The gods that did not make the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from under these heavens.”\n¶It is He who made the earth by His power,\nWho established the world by His wisdom;\nAnd by His understanding He has stretched out the heavens.\nWhen He utters His voice, there is a roar of waters in the heavens,\nAnd He makes the clouds ascend from the end of the earth;\nHe makes lightning for the rain,\nAnd brings out the wind from His storehouses.\nEvery person is stupid, devoid of knowledge;\nEvery goldsmith is put to shame by his idols,\nFor his cast metal images are deceitful,\nAnd there is no breath in them.\nThey are worthless, a work of mockery;\nAt the time of their punishment they will perish.\nThe Portion of Jacob is not like these;\nFor He is the Maker of everything,\nAnd Israel is the tribe of His inheritance;\nThe LORD of armies is His name.\n¶Pick up your bundle from the ground,\nYou who live under siege!\nFor this is what the LORD says:\n“Behold, I am slinging out the inhabitants of the land\nAt this time,\nAnd I will cause them distress,\nSo that they may be found.”\n¶Woe to me, because of my injury!\nMy wound is incurable.\nBut I said, “This certainly is a sickness,\nAnd I must endure it.”\nMy tent is destroyed,\nAnd all my ropes are broken.\nMy sons have gone from me and are no more.\nThere is no one to stretch out my tent again\nOr to set up my curtains.\nFor the shepherds have become stupid\nAnd have not sought the LORD.\nTherefore they have not prospered,\nAnd all their flock is scattered.\nThe sound of a report! Behold, it is coming—\nA great roar from the land of the north—\nTo make the cities of Judah\nA desolation, a haunt of jackals.\n¶I know, LORD, that a person’s way is not in himself,\nNor is it in a person who walks to direct his steps.\nCorrect me, LORD, but with justice;\nNot with Your anger, or You will bring me to nothing.\nPour out Your wrath on the nations that do not know You,\nAnd on the families who do not call upon Your name;\nFor they have devoured Jacob;\nThey have devoured him and consumed him,\nAnd have laid waste his settlement.",

For I solemnly warned your fathers on the day I brought them up from the land of Egypt, even to this day, warning them persistently, saying, “Listen to My voice.” Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked in the stubbornness of their evil heart, each one of them; therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant which I commanded them to do, but they did not.’ ”\nThen the LORD said to me, “A conspiracy has been found among the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. They have turned back to the wrongdoings of their ancestors who refused to hear My words, and they have followed other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers.” Therefore this is what the LORD says: “Behold, I am bringing disaster on them which they will not be able to escape; though they will cry out to Me, I will not listen to them. Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they certainly will not save them in the time of their disaster. For your gods are as many as your cities, Judah; and as many as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to the shameful thing, altars for burning incense to Baal.\n“So as for you, do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry or prayer for them; for I will not listen when they call to Me because of their disaster.\n“What right has My beloved in My house\nWhen she has carried out many evil schemes?\nCan the sacrificial flesh take away from you your disaster,\nSo that you can rejoice?”\nThe LORD named you\n“A green olive tree, beautiful in fruit and form”;\nWith the noise of a great tumult\nHe has set fire to it,\nAnd its branches are worthless.\nThe LORD of armies, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you because of the evil of the house of Israel and the house of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me by offering sacrifices to Baal.\n\n¶Moreover, the LORD made it known to me and I knew it;\nThen You showed me their deeds.\nBut I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter;\nAnd I did not know that they had devised plots against me, saying,\n“Let’s destroy the tree with its fruit,\nAnd let’s cut him off from the land of the living,\nSo that his name will no longer be remembered.”\nBut, LORD of armies, who judges righteously,\nWho puts the feelings and the heart to the test,\nLet me see Your vengeance on them,\nFor to You I have committed my cause.\nTherefore this is what the LORD says concerning the people of Anathoth, who are seeking your life, saying: “Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD, so that you do not die by our hand”; therefore, this is what the LORD of armies says: “Behold, I am going to punish them! The young men will die by the sword, their sons and daughters will die by famine; and a remnant will not be left to them, because I will bring disaster on the people of Anathoth—the year of their punishment.”",

And it will come about that after I have driven them out, I will again have compassion on them; and I will bring them back, each one to his inheritance and each one to his land. Then, if they will really learn the ways of My people, to swear by My name, ‘As the LORD lives,’ just as they taught My people to swear by Baal, they will be built up in the midst of My people. But if they do not listen, then I will drive out that nation, drive it out and destroy it,” declares the LORD.",

Then the word of the LORD came to me a second time, saying, “Take the undergarment that you bought, which is around your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates and hide it there in a crevice of the rock.” So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the LORD had commanded me. After many days the LORD said to me, “Arise, go to the Euphrates and take from there the undergarment which I commanded you to hide there.” Then I went to the Euphrates and dug, and I took the undergarment from the place where I had hidden it; and behold, the undergarment was ruined, it was completely useless.\nThen the word of the LORD came to me, saying, “This is what the LORD says: ‘To the same extent I will destroy the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem. This wicked people, who refuse to listen to My words, who walk in the stubbornness of their hearts and have followed other gods to serve them and to bow down to them, let them be just like this undergarment which is completely useless. For as the undergarment clings to the waist of a man, so I made the entire household of Israel and the entire household of Judah cling to Me,’ declares the LORD, ‘so that they might be My people, for renown, for praise, and for glory; but they did not listen.’\n\n“Therefore you are to speak this word to them. ‘This is what the LORD, the God of Israel says: “Every jug is to be filled with wine.” ’ And when they say to you, ‘Do we not very well know that every jug is to be filled with wine?’ then say to them, ‘This is what the LORD says: “Behold, I am going to fill all the inhabitants of this land—the kings who sit for David on his throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem—with drunkenness! Then I will smash them against each other, both the fathers and the sons together,” declares the LORD. “I will not have compassion nor be troubled nor take pity so as to keep from destroying them.” ’ ”\n¶Listen and pay attention, do not be haughty;\nFor the LORD has spoken.\nGive glory to the LORD your God\nBefore He brings darkness\nAnd before your feet stumble\nOn the mountains in the dark,\nAnd while you are hoping for light\nHe makes it into gloom,\nAnd turns it into thick darkness.\nBut if you do not listen to it,\nMy soul will weep in secret for such pride;\nAnd my eyes will shed\nAnd stream down tears,\nBecause the flock of the LORD has been taken captive.\nSay to the king and the queen mother,\n“Take a lowly seat,\nFor your beautiful crown\nHas come down from your head.”\nThe cities of the Negev have been locked up,\nAnd there is no one to open them;\nAll Judah has been taken into exile,\nWholly taken into exile.\n¶“Raise your eyes and see\nThose coming from the north.\nWhere is the flock that was given you,\nYour beautiful sheep?\n“What will you say when He appoints over you—\nAnd you yourself had taught them—\nFormer companions to be head over you?\nWill sharp pains not take hold of you\nLike a woman in childbirth?\n“If you say in your heart,\n‘Why have these things happened to me?’\nBecause of the magnitude of your wrongdoing\nYour skirts have been removed\nAnd your heels have suffered violence.\n“Can the Ethiopian change his skin,\nOr the leopard his spots?\nThen you as well can do good\nWho are accustomed to doing evil.\n“Therefore I will scatter them like drifting straw\nTo the desert wind.\n“This is your lot, the portion measured to you\nFrom Me,” declares the LORD,\n“Because you have forgotten Me\nAnd trusted in falsehood.\n“So I Myself have stripped your skirts off over your face,\nSo that your shame will be seen.\n“As for your adulteries and your lustful neighings,\nThe outrageous sin of your prostitution\nOn the hills in the field,\nI have seen your abominations.\nWoe to you, Jerusalem!\nHow long will you remain unclean?”",

Therefore the LORD does not accept them; now He will remember their wrongdoing and call their sins to account.” So the LORD said to me, “Do not pray for a good outcome on behalf of this people. When they fast, I am not going to listen to their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I am not going to accept them. Rather, I am going to put an end to them by the sword, famine, and plague.”\n\nBut I said, “Oh, Lord GOD! Behold, the prophets are telling them, ‘You will not see a sword, nor will you have famine; on the contrary, I will give you lasting peace in this place.’ ” Then the LORD said to me, “The prophets are prophesying falsehood in My name. I have neither sent them nor commanded them, nor spoken to them; they are prophesying to you a false vision, divination, futility, and the deception of their own minds. Therefore this is what the LORD says concerning the prophets who are prophesying in My name, although it was not I who sent them—yet they keep saying: ‘There will be no sword or famine in this land’—by sword and famine those prophets shall meet their end! And the people to whom they are prophesying will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and there will be no one to bury them—neither them, nor their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters. For I will pour out their own wickedness upon them.\n“You will say this word to them,\n‘Let my eyes stream down tears night and day,\nAnd let them not cease;\nFor the virgin daughter of my people has been crushed with a mighty blow,\nWith a sorely infected wound.\n‘If I go out to the country,\nThere are those killed by the sword!\nOr if I enter the city,\nThere are diseases from famine!\nFor both prophet and priest\nHave wandered around in the land that they do not know.’ ”\n¶Have You completely rejected Judah?\nOr have You loathed Zion?\nWhy have You stricken us so that we are beyond healing?\nWe waited for peace, but nothing good came;\nAnd for a time of healing, but behold, terror!\nWe know our wickedness, LORD,\nThe wrongdoing of our fathers, for we have sinned against You.\nDo not despise us, for the sake of Your own name;\nDo not disgrace the throne of Your glory.\nRemember and do not annul Your covenant with us.\nAre there any among the idols of the nations who give rain?\nOr can the heavens grant showers?\nIs it not You, LORD our God?\nTherefore we wait for You,\nFor You are the one who has done all these things.",

I will make them an object of terror among all the kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem.\n¶“Indeed, who will have pity on you, Jerusalem,\nOr who will mourn for you,\nOr who will turn aside to ask about your welfare?\n“You who have forsaken Me,” declares the LORD,\n“You keep going backward.\nSo I will stretch out My hand against you and destroy you;\nI am tired of relenting!\n“I will winnow them with a winnowing fork\nAt the gates of the land;\nI will bereave them of children, I will destroy My people;\nThey did not repent of their ways.\n“Their widows will be more numerous before Me\nThan the sand of the seas;\nI will bring against them, against the mother of a young man,\nA destroyer at noon;\nI will suddenly bring down on her\nShock and horror.\n“She who gave birth to seven sons withers away;\nHer breathing is labored.\nHer sun has set while it was still day;\nShe has been shamed and humiliated.\nSo I will turn over their survivors to the sword\nBefore their enemies,” declares the LORD.\n¶Woe to me, my mother, that you have given birth to me\nAs a man of strife and a man of contention to all the land!\nI have not lent, nor have people lent money to me,\nYet everyone curses me.\nThe LORD said, “I will certainly set you free for purposes of good;\nI will certainly make the enemy plead with you\nIn a time of disaster and a time of distress.\n¶“Can anyone smash iron,\nIron from the north, or bronze?\n“I will give your wealth and your treasures\nAs plunder without cost,\nFor all your sins\nAnd within all your borders.\n“Then I will make your enemies bring your possessions\nInto a land that you do not know;\nFor a fire has been kindled in My anger,\nAnd it will burn upon you.”\n\n¶You know, LORD;\nRemember me, take notice of me,\nAnd take vengeance for me on my persecutors.\nDo not, in view of Your patience, take me away;\nKnow that for Your sake I endure reproach.\nYour words were found and I ate them,\nAnd Your words became a joy to me and the delight of my heart;\nFor I have been called by Your name,\nLORD God of armies.\nI did not sit in a circle of revelers and celebrate.\nBecause of Your hand upon me I sat alone,\nFor You filled me with indignation.\nWhy has my pain been endless\nAnd my wound incurable, refusing to be healed?\nWill You indeed be to me like a deceptive stream\nWith water that is unreliable?\n¶Therefore, this is what the LORD says:\n“If you return, then I will restore you—\nYou will stand before Me;\nAnd if you extract the precious from the worthless,\nYou will become My spokesman.\nThey, for their part, may turn to you,\nBut as for you, you are not to turn to them.\n“Then I will make you to this people\nA fortified wall of bronze;\nAnd though they fight against you,\nThey will not prevail over you;\nFor I am with you to save you\nAnd rescue you,” declares the LORD.\n“So I will rescue you from the hand of the wicked,\nAnd I will redeem you from the grasp of the violent.”",

And they will perish by sword and famine, and their dead bodies will become food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth.”\nFor this is what the LORD says: “Do not enter a house of mourning, or go to mourn or to console them; for I have withdrawn My peace from this people,” declares the LORD, “and My favor and compassion. Both great people and small will die in this land; they will not be buried, people will not mourn for them, nor will anyone make cuts on himself or have his head shaved for them. People will not break bread in mourning for them, to comfort anyone for the dead, nor give them a cup of consolation to drink for anyone’s father or mother. Moreover, you shall not go into a house of feasting to sit with them to eat and drink.” For this is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: “Behold, I am going to eliminate from this place, before your eyes and in your time, the voice of rejoicing and the voice of joy, the voice of the groom and the voice of the bride.\n“Now it will happen that, when you tell this people all these words, they will say to you, ‘For what reason has the LORD declared all this great disaster against us? And what is our wrongdoing, or what is our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?’ Then you are to say to them, ‘It is because your forefathers have abandoned Me,’ declares the LORD, ‘and have followed other gods, and served and worshiped them; but they have abandoned Me and have not kept My Law. You too have done evil, even more than your forefathers; for behold, each one of you is following the stubbornness of his own evil heart, without listening to Me. So I will hurl you off this land to the land which you have not known, neither you nor your fathers; and there you will serve other gods day and night, because I will show you no compassion.’\n\n“Therefore behold, days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when it will no longer be said, ‘As the LORD lives, who brought up the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt,’ but, ‘As the LORD lives, who brought up the sons of Israel from the land of the north and from all the lands where He had banished them.’ For I will restore them to their own land which I gave to their fathers.\n“Behold, I am going to send for many fishermen,” declares the LORD, “and they will fish for them; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them from every mountain and every hill and from the clefts of the rocks. For My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from My face, nor is their wrongdoing concealed from My eyes. I will first repay them double for their wrongdoing and their sin, because they have defiled My land; they have filled My inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable idols and their abominations.”\n¶LORD, my strength and my stronghold,\nAnd my refuge in the day of distress,\nTo You the nations will come\nFrom the ends of the earth and say,\n“Our fathers have inherited nothing but falsehood,\nFutility, and things of no benefit.”\nCan a person make gods for himself?\nBut they are not gods!\n¶“Therefore behold, I am going to make them know—\nThis time I will make them know\nMy power and My might;\nAnd they will know that My name is the LORD.”",

This is what the LORD says: “Take care for yourselves, and do not carry any load on the Sabbath day or bring anything in through the gates of Jerusalem. You shall not bring a load out of your houses on the Sabbath day nor do any work, but keep the Sabbath day holy, just as I commanded your forefathers. Yet they did not listen or incline their ears, but stiffened their necks so as not to listen or accept discipline.\n“But it will come about, if you give your attention to Me,” declares the LORD, “to bring no load in through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, but to keep the Sabbath day holy by doing no work on it, then there will come in through the gates of this city kings and officials sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their officials, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and this city will be inhabited forever. They will come in from the cities of Judah and from the areas surrounding Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, from the lowland, from the hill country, and from the Negev, bringing burnt offerings, sacrifices, grain offerings, and frankincense, and bringing sacrifices of thanksgiving to the house of the LORD. But if you do not listen to Me, to keep the Sabbath day holy by not carrying a load and coming in through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will set fire to its gates, and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem and not go out.” ’ ”",

But the vessel that he was making of clay was spoiled in the hand of the potter; so he remade it into another vessel, as it pleased the potter to make.\nThen the word of the LORD came to me, saying, “Am I not able, house of Israel, to deal with you as this potter does?” declares the LORD. “Behold, like the clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in My hand, house of Israel. At one moment I might speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom to uproot it, to tear it down, or to destroy it; if that nation against which I have spoken turns from its evil, I will relent of the disaster that I planned to bring on it. Or at another moment I might speak concerning a nation or concerning a kingdom to build up or to plant it; if it does evil in My sight by not obeying My voice, then I will relent of the good with which I said that I would bless it. So now, speak to the men of Judah and against the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, ‘This is what the LORD says: “Behold, I am forming a disaster against you and devising a plan against you. Now turn back, each of you from his evil way, and correct your ways and your deeds!” ’ But they will say, ‘It’s hopeless! For we are going to follow our own plans, and each of us will persist in the stubbornness of his evil heart.’\n¶“Therefore this is what the LORD says:\n‘Just ask among the nations,\nWho ever heard anything like this?\nThe virgin of Israel\nHas done a most appalling thing.\n‘Does the snow of Lebanon leave the rock of the open country alone?\nOr is the cold flowing water from a foreign land ever dried up?\n‘For My people have forgotten Me,\nThey burn incense to worthless gods.\nAnd they have stumbled in their ways,\nIn the ancient roads,\nTo walk on paths,\nNot on a highway,\nTo make their land a desolation,\nAn object of perpetual hissing;\nEveryone who passes by it will be astonished\nAnd shake his head.\n‘Like an east wind I will scatter them\nBefore the enemy;\nI will show them My back and not My face\nIn the day of their disaster.’ ”\nThen they said, “Come and let’s devise plans against Jeremiah. Certainly the Law is not going to be lost by the priest, nor advice by the wise, nor the divine word by the prophet! Come, and let’s strike at him with our tongue, and let’s pay no attention to any of his words.”\n¶Give Your attention to me, LORD,\nAnd listen to what my opponents are saying!\nShould good be repaid with evil?\nFor they have dug a pit for me.\nRemember how I stood before You\nTo speak good in their behalf,\nSo as to turn Your wrath away from them.\nTherefore, give their children over to famine\nAnd turn them over to the power of the sword;\nAnd let their wives become childless and widowed.\nLet their men also be slaughtered to death,\nTheir young men struck and killed by the sword in battle.\nMay a cry be heard from their houses\nWhen You suddenly bring raiders upon them;\nFor they have dug a pit to capture me\nAnd hidden snares for my feet.\nBut You, LORD, know\nAll their deadly schemes against me;\nDo not forgive their wrongdoing\nOr wipe out their sin from Your sight.\nBut may they be overthrown before You;\nDeal with them in the time of Your anger!",

Since they have abandoned Me and have made this place foreign, and have burned sacrifices in it to other gods that neither they nor their forefathers nor the kings of Judah had ever known, and since they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, a thing which I did not command nor speak of, nor did it ever enter My mind; therefore, behold, days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the Valley of Ben-hinnom, but rather the Valley of Slaughter. And I will frustrate the planning of Judah and Jerusalem in this place, and I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hand of those who seek their life; and I will make their carcasses food for the birds of the sky and the animals of the earth.

And you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house will go into captivity; and you will enter Babylon, and there you will die and there you will be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have falsely prophesied.’ ”\n\n¶LORD, You persuaded me and I let myself be persuaded;\nYou have overcome me and prevailed.\nI have become a laughingstock all day long;\nEveryone mocks me.\nFor each time I speak, I cry aloud;\nI proclaim violence and destruction,\nBecause for me the word of the LORD has resulted\nIn taunting and derision all day long.\nBut if I say, “I will not remember Him\nNor speak anymore in His name,”\nThen in my heart it becomes like a burning fire\nShut up in my bones;\nAnd I am tired of holding it in,\nAnd I cannot endure it.\nFor I have heard the whispering of many,\n“Terror on every side!\nDenounce him; let’s denounce him!”\nAll my trusted friends,\nWatching for my fall, say:\n“Perhaps he will be persuaded, so that we may prevail against him\nAnd take our revenge on him.”\nBut the LORD is with me like a powerful champion;\nTherefore my persecutors will stumble and not prevail.\nThey will be put to great shame because they have failed,\nAn everlasting disgrace that will not be forgotten.\nYet, LORD of armies, who tests the righteous,\nWho sees the mind and the heart;\nLet me see Your vengeance on them,\nFor to You I have disclosed my cause.\nSing to the LORD, praise the LORD!\nFor He has saved the soul of the needy one\nFrom the hand of evildoers.\n¶Cursed be the day when I was born;\nMay the day when my mother gave birth to me not be blessed!\nCursed be the man who brought the news\nTo my father, saying,\n“A boy has been born to you!”\nAnd made him very happy.\nBut may that man be like the cities\nWhich the LORD overthrew without relenting,\nAnd may he hear an outcry in the morning\nAnd an alarm for war at noon;\nBecause he did not kill me before birth,\nSo that my mother would have been my grave,\nAnd her womb forever pregnant.\nWhy did I ever come out of the womb\nTo look at trouble and sorrow,\nSo that my days have been spent in shame?",

For I have set My face against this city for harm and not for good,” declares the LORD. “It will be handed over to the king of Babylon and he will burn it with fire.” ’\n“Then say to the household of the king of Judah, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, house of David, this is what the LORD says:\n“Administer justice every morning;\nAnd save the person who has been robbed from the power of his oppressor,\nSo that My wrath will not spread like fire\nAnd burn, with no one to extinguish it,\nBecause of the evil of their deeds.\n¶“Behold, I am against you, you inhabitant of the valley,\nYou rocky plain,” declares the LORD,\n“You who say, ‘Who will come down against us?\nOr who will enter our dwellings?’\n“But I will punish you according to the results of your deeds,” declares the LORD,\n“And I will kindle a fire in its forest\nSo that it may devour all its surroundings.” ’ ”",

But if you will not obey these words, I swear by Myself,” declares the LORD, “that this house will become a place of ruins.” ’ ” For this is what the LORD says concerning the house of the king of Judah:\n“You are like Gilead to Me,\nLike the summit of Lebanon;\nYet most assuredly I will make you a wilderness,\nCities that are not inhabited.\n“For I will set apart destroyers against you,\nEach with his weapons;\nAnd they will cut down your choicest cedars\nAnd throw them on the fire.\n“Many nations will pass by this city; and they will say to one another, ‘Why has the LORD done this to this great city?’ Then they will answer, ‘Because they abandoned the covenant of the LORD their God and bowed down to other gods and served them.’ ”\n¶Do not weep for the dead or mourn for him,\nBut weep deeply for the one who goes away;\nFor he will never return\nOr see his native land.\nFor this is what the LORD says regarding Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who became king in the place of his father Josiah, who went out from this place: “He will never return there; but in the place where they took him into exile, there he will die and he will not see this land again.\n\n¶“Woe to him who builds his house without righteousness,\nAnd his upstairs rooms without justice,\nWho uses his neighbor’s services without pay\nAnd does not give him his wages,\nWho says, ‘I will build myself a large house\nWith spacious upstairs rooms,\nAnd cut out its windows,\nPaneling it with cedar and painting it bright red.’\n“Do you become a king because you are competing in cedar?\nDid your father not eat and drink\nAnd do justice and righteousness?\nThen it was well for him.\n“He pled the cause of the afflicted and the poor,\nThen it was well.\nIs that not what it means to know Me?”\nDeclares the LORD.\n“But your eyes and your heart\nAre intent only upon your own dishonest gain,\nAnd on shedding innocent blood,\nAnd on practicing oppression and extortion.”\nTherefore this is what the LORD says regarding Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:\n“They will not mourn for him:\n‘Oh, my brother!’ or, ‘Oh, sister!’\nThey will not mourn for him:\n‘Oh, for the master!’ or, ‘Oh, for his splendor!’\n“He will be buried with a donkey’s burial,\nDragged off and thrown out beyond the gates of Jerusalem.\n“Go up to Lebanon and cry out,\nAnd raise your voice in Bashan;\nCry out also from Abarim,\nFor all your lovers have been crushed.\n“I spoke to you in your prosperity;\nBut you said, ‘I will not listen!’\nThis has been your way from your youth,\nThat you have not obeyed My voice.\n“The wind will sweep away all your shepherds,\nAnd your lovers will go into captivity;\nThen you will certainly be ashamed and humiliated\nBecause of all your wickedness.\n“You who live in Lebanon,\nNested in the cedars,\nHow you will groan when sharp pains come on you,\nPain like a woman in childbirth!\n“As I live,” declares the LORD, “even if Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were a signet ring on My right hand, yet I would pull you off; and I will hand you over to those who are seeking your life, yes, to those of whom you are frightened, that is, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the Chaldeans. I will hurl you and your mother who gave birth to you into another country where you were not born, and there you will die. But as for the land to which they long to return, they will not return to it.\n“Is this man Coniah a despised, shattered jar?\nOr is he an undesirable vessel?\nWhy have he and his descendants been hurled out\nAnd cast into a land that they had not known?\n“O land, land, land,\nHear the word of the LORD!\nThis is what the LORD says:\n‘Write this man down as childless,\nA man who will not prosper in his days;\nFor no man among his descendants will prosper\nSitting on the throne of David\nOr ruling again in Judah.’ ”",

Therefore this is what the LORD, the God of Israel says concerning the shepherds who are tending My people: “You have scattered My flock and driven them away, and have not been concerned about them; behold, I am going to call you to account for the evil of your deeds,” declares the LORD. “Then I Myself will gather the remnant of My flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and bring them back to their pasture, and they will be fruitful and multiply. I will also raise up shepherds over them and they will tend them; and they will not be afraid any longer, nor be terrified, nor will any be missing,” declares the LORD.\n¶“Behold, the days are coming,” declares the LORD,\n“When I will raise up for David a righteous Branch;\nAnd He will reign as king and act wisely\nAnd do justice and righteousness in the land.\n“In His days Judah will be saved,\nAnd Israel will live securely;\nAnd this is His name by which He will be called,\n‘The LORD Our Righteousness.’\n“Therefore behold, the days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when they will no longer say, ‘As the LORD lives, who brought the sons of Israel up from the land of Egypt,’ but, ‘As the LORD lives, who brought up and led the descendants of the household of Israel back from the north land and from all the countries where I had driven them.’ Then they will live on their own soil.”\n\n¶As for the prophets:\nMy heart is broken within me,\nAll my bones tremble;\nI have become like a drunken man,\nAnd like a man overcome by wine,\nBecause of the LORD\nAnd because of His holy words.\nFor the land is full of adulterers;\nFor the land mourns because of the curse.\nThe pastures of the wilderness have dried up.\nTheir course is evil\nAnd their might is not right.\n“For both prophet and priest are defiled;\nEven in My house I have found their wickedness,” declares the LORD.\n“Therefore their way will be like slippery paths to them,\nThey will be driven away into the gloom and fall down in it;\nFor I will bring disaster upon them,\nThe year of their punishment,” declares the LORD.\n¶“Moreover, among the prophets of Samaria I saw an offensive thing:\nThey prophesied by Baal and led My people Israel astray.\n“Also among the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing:\nThe committing of adultery and walking in deceit;\nAnd they strengthen the hands of evildoers,\nSo that no one has turned back from his wickedness.\nAll of them have become to Me like Sodom,\nAnd her inhabitants like Gomorrah.\nTherefore this is what the LORD of armies says concerning the prophets:\n‘Behold, I am going to feed them wormwood\nAnd make them drink poisonous water,\nFor from the prophets of Jerusalem\nUngodliness has spread into all the land.’ ”\n¶This is what the LORD of armies says:\n“Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are prophesying to you.\nThey are leading you into futility;\nThey tell a vision of their own imagination,\nNot from the mouth of the LORD.\n“They keep saying to those who despise Me,\n‘The LORD has said, “You will have peace” ’;\nAnd as for everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart,\nThey say, ‘Disaster will not come on you.’\n“But who has stood in the council of the LORD,\nThat he should see and hear His word?\nWho has paid attention to His word and listened?\n“Behold, the storm of the LORD has gone forth in wrath,\nEven a whirling tempest;\nIt will swirl down on the head of the wicked.\n“The anger of the LORD will not turn back\nUntil He has performed and carried out the purposes of His heart;\nIn the last days you will clearly understand it.\n“I did not send these prophets,\nBut they ran.\nI did not speak to them,\nBut they prophesied.\n“But if they had stood in My council,\nThen they would have announced My words to My people,\nAnd would have turned them back from their evil way\nAnd from the evil of their deeds.\n¶“Am I a God who is near,” declares the LORD,\n“And not a God far off?\n“Can a person hide himself in hiding places\nSo that I do not see him?” declares the LORD.\n“Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?” declares the LORD.\n“I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy falsely in My name, saying, ‘I had a dream, I had a dream!’ How long? Is there anything in the hearts of the prophets who prophesy falsehood, these prophets of the deceitfulness of their own heart, who intend to make My people forget My name by their dreams which they report to one another, just as their fathers forgot My name because of Baal? The prophet who has a dream may report his dream, but let him who has My word speak My word truthfully. What does straw have in common with grain?” declares the LORD. “Is My word not like fire?” declares the LORD, “and like a hammer which shatters a rock? Therefore behold, I am against the prophets,” declares the LORD, “who steal My words from each other. Behold, I am against the prophets,” declares the LORD, “who use their tongues and declare, ‘The Lord declares!’ Behold, I am against those who have prophesied false dreams,” declares the LORD, “and reported them and led My people astray by their lies and reckless boasting; yet I did not send them nor command them, nor do they provide this people the slightest benefit,” declares the LORD.\n“Now when this people or the prophet or a priest asks you, saying, ‘What is the pronouncement of the LORD?’ then you shall say to them, ‘What pronouncement?’ The LORD declares, ‘I will abandon you.’ Then as for the prophet or the priest or the people who say, ‘The pronouncement of the LORD,’ I will bring punishment upon that person and his household. This is what each one of you will say to his neighbor and to his brother: ‘What has the LORD answered?’ or, ‘What has the LORD spoken?’ For you will no longer remember the pronouncement of the LORD, because every person’s own word will become the pronouncement, and you have perverted the words of the living God, the LORD of armies, our God. This is what you will say to that prophet: ‘What has the LORD answered you?’ and, ‘What has the LORD spoken?’ And if you say, ‘The pronouncement of the LORD!’ for that reason the LORD says this: ‘Because you said this word, “The pronouncement of the LORD!” I have also sent word to you, saying, “You shall not say, ‘The pronouncement of the LORD!’ ” ’ Therefore behold, I will certainly forget you and thrust you away from My presence, along with the city which I gave you and your fathers. I will put an everlasting disgrace on you and an everlasting humiliation which will not be forgotten.”",

One basket had very good figs, like first-ripe figs, and the other basket had very bad figs which could not be eaten due to rottenness. Then the LORD said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” And I said, “Figs: the good figs are very good, and the bad ones, very bad, which cannot be eaten due to rottenness.”\nThen the word of the LORD came to me, saying, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel says: ‘Like these good figs, so I will regard as good the captives of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans. For I will set My eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this land; and I will build them up and not overthrow them, and I will plant them and not uproot them. I will also give them a heart to know Me, for I am the LORD; and they will be My people, and I will be their God, for they will return to Me wholeheartedly.\n‘But like the bad figs which cannot be eaten due to rottenness,’ indeed, this is what the LORD says, ‘so will I give up Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials, and the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and the ones who live in the land of Egypt.

And the LORD has sent to you all His servants the prophets again and again, but you have not listened nor inclined your ear to hear, saying, ‘Turn now, everyone from his evil way and from the evil of your deeds, and live on the land which the LORD has given to you and your forefathers forever and ever; and do not follow other gods to serve them and to worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands, then I will do you no harm.’ Yet you have not listened to Me,” declares the LORD, “in order to provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands to your own harm.\n“Therefore this is what the LORD of armies says: ‘Because you have not obeyed My words, behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,’ declares the LORD, ‘and I will send to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, My servant, and will bring them against this land and against its inhabitants and against all these surrounding nations; and I will completely destroy them and make them an object of horror and hissing, and an everlasting place of ruins. Moreover, I will eliminate from them the voice of jubilation and the voice of joy, the voice of the groom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp. This entire land will be a place of ruins and an object of horror, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.\n\n‘Then it will be when seventy years are completed I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,’ declares the LORD, ‘for their wrongdoing, and the land of the Chaldeans; and I will make it an everlasting desolation. I will bring upon that land all My words which I have pronounced against it, all that is written in this book which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations. (For many nations and great kings will make slaves of them, even them; and I will repay them according to their deeds and according to the work of their hands.)’ ”\nFor this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to me: “Take this cup of the wine of wrath from My hand and give it to all the nations to whom I send you, to drink from it. Then they will drink and loudly vomit and act insanely because of the sword that I am going to send among them.”\nSo I took the cup from the LORD’S hand and gave it to all the nations to whom the LORD sent me, to drink from it: To Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, and its kings and its officials, to make them places of ruins, objects of horror, hissing, and a curse, as it is this day; To Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his officials, and all his people; and to all the foreign people, all the kings of the land of Uz, all the kings of the land of the Philistines (that is, Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod); To Edom, Moab, and the sons of Ammon; and to all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the coastlands which are beyond the sea; and to Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who trim the corners of their hair; and to all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the foreign people who live in the desert; and to all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media; and to all the kings of the north, near and far, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the earth which are on the face of the ground; and the king of Sheshach shall drink it after them.\n“And you shall say to them, ‘This is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: “Drink, be drunk, vomit, fall down, and do not get up, because of the sword which I am sending among you.” ’ And if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, ‘This is what the LORD of armies says: “You shall certainly drink! For behold, I am beginning to inflict disaster on this city which is called by My name, so should you be completely free from punishment? You will not be free from punishment, for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth,” declares the LORD of armies.’\n“Therefore you shall prophesy against them all these words, and you shall say to them,\n‘The LORD will roar from on high\nAnd raise His voice from His holy dwelling;\nHe will roar forcefully against His fold.\nHe will shout like those who tread the grapes,\nAgainst all the inhabitants of the earth.\n‘A clamor has come to the end of the earth,\nBecause the LORD has a controversy with the nations.\nHe is entering into judgment with humanity;\nAs for the wicked, He has turned them over to the sword,’ declares the LORD.”\n¶This is what the LORD of armies says:\n“Behold, evil is going out\nFrom nation to nation,\nAnd a great storm is being stirred up\nFrom the remotest parts of the earth.\n“Those put to death by the LORD on that day will be from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be mourned, gathered, or buried; they will be like dung on the face of the ground.\n“Wail, you shepherds, and cry out;\nWallow in the dust, you masters of the flock;\nFor the days of your slaughter and your dispersions have come,\nAnd you will fall like a precious vessel.\n“There will be no sanctuary for the shepherds,\nNor escape for the masters of the flock.\n“Hear the sound of the cry of the shepherds,\nAnd the wailing of the masters of the flock!\nFor the LORD is destroying their pasture,\nAnd the peaceful grazing places are devastated\nBecause of the fierce anger of the LORD.\n“He has left His hiding place like the lion;\nFor their land has become a horror\nBecause of the fierceness of the oppressing sword\nAnd because of His fierce anger.”",

Do not omit a word! Perhaps they will listen and everyone will turn from his evil way, and I will relent of the disaster which I am planning to inflict on them because of the evil of their deeds.’ And you shall say to them, ‘This is what the LORD says: “If you do not listen to Me, to walk in My Law which I have set before you, to listen to the words of My servants the prophets, whom I have been sending to you again and again, but you have not listened; then I will make this house like Shiloh, and I will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.” ’ ”\n\nThe priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD. Yet when Jeremiah finished speaking everything that the LORD had commanded him to speak to all the people, then the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him, saying, “You must die! Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, ‘This house will be like Shiloh and this city will be in ruins, without inhabitant’?” And all the people gathered to Jeremiah at the house of the LORD.\nWhen the officials of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king’s house to the house of the LORD and sat at the entrance of the New Gate of the LORD’S house. Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the officials and to all the people, saying, “A death sentence for this man! For he has prophesied against this city, just as you have heard with your own ears!”\nThen Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and to all the people, saying, “The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard. Now then, reform your ways and your deeds and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will relent of the disaster which He has pronounced against you. But as for me, behold, I am in your hands; do with me as is good and right in your sight. Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood on yourselves, and on this city and its inhabitants; for truly the LORD has sent me to you to speak all these words so that you hear them.”\n\nThen the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, “No death sentence for this man! For he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.” Then some of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying, “Micah of Moresheth used to prophesy in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah; and he spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, ‘This is what the LORD of armies has said:\n“Zion will be plowed like a field,\nAnd Jerusalem will become heaps of ruins,\nAnd the mountain of the house like the high places of a forest.” ’\nDid Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah actually put him to death? Did he not fear the LORD and plead for the favor of the LORD, and the LORD relented of the disaster which He had pronounced against them? But we are committing a great evil against our own lives!”\nIndeed, there was also a man who used to prophesy in the name of the LORD, Uriah the son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim; and he prophesied against this city and against this land words similar to all those of Jeremiah. When King Jehoiakim and all his warriors and all the officials heard his words, then the king sought to put him to death; but Uriah heard about it, and he was afraid, so he fled and went to Egypt. Then King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt: Elnathan the son of Achbor and certain men with him, to Egypt. And they brought Uriah from Egypt and led him to King Jehoiakim, who killed him with a sword and threw his dead body into the burial place of the common people.\nBut the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that he was not handed over to the people to put him to death.",

Order them to go to their masters, saying, ‘This is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: “This is what you shall say to your masters: ‘I have made the earth, mankind, and the animals which are on the face of the earth by My great power and by My outstretched arm, and I will give it to the one who is pleasing in My sight. And now I have handed all these lands over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, My servant, and I have also given him the animals of the field to serve him. All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson until the time of his own land comes; then many nations and great kings will make him their servant.\n‘And it will be that the nation or the kingdom which will not serve him, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and will not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation with the sword, with famine, and with plague,’ declares the LORD, ‘until I have eliminated it by his hand. And as for you, do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your soothsayers, or your sorcerers who talk to you, saying, “You will not serve the king of Babylon.” For they are prophesying a lie to you in order to remove you far from your land; and I will drive you away and you will perish. But the nation that will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will let remain on its land,’ declares the LORD, ‘and they will cultivate it and live in it.’ ” ’ ”\nI spoke words like all these to Zedekiah king of Judah, saying, “Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people, and live! Why should you die, you and your people, by the sword, famine, and plague, as the LORD has spoken to the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? So do not listen to the words of the prophets who talk to you, saying, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they are prophesying a lie to you; for I have not sent them,” declares the LORD, “but they are prophesying falsely in My name, so that I will drive you away and that you will perish, you and the prophets who prophesy to you.”\nThen I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying: “This is what the LORD says: ‘Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, “Behold, the vessels of the LORD’S house will now shortly be brought back from Babylon”; for they are prophesying a lie to you. Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live! Why should this city become a place of ruins? But if they are prophets, and if the word of the LORD is with them, have them now plead with the LORD of armies that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD and the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem do not go to Babylon. For this is what the LORD of armies says concerning the pillars, concerning the sea, concerning the kettle stands, and concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in this city, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he led into exile Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem— Yes, this is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel, says concerning the vessels that are left in the house of the LORD and in the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem: “They will be brought to Babylon and will be there until the day I visit them,” declares the LORD. “Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.” ’ ”",

Within two years I am going to bring back to this place all the vessels of the LORD’S house, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took from this place and brought to Babylon. I am also going to bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the exiles of Judah who went to Babylon,’ declares the LORD, ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’ ”\nThen Jeremiah the prophet spoke to the prophet Hananiah in the sight of the priests and in the sight of all the people who were standing at the house of the LORD, and Jeremiah the prophet said, “Amen! May the LORD do so; may the LORD fulfill your words which you have prophesied, to bring back the vessels of the LORD’S house and all the exiles, from Babylon to this place. Yet hear now this word which I am going to speak so that you and all the people can hear it! The prophets who were before me and before you from ancient times also prophesied against many lands and against great kingdoms regarding war, disaster, and plague. As for the prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet comes to pass, then that prophet will be known as one whom the LORD has truly sent.”\nThen Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it. Hananiah spoke in the sight of all the people, saying, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Even so within two full years I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations.’ ” Then Jeremiah the prophet went his way.\nThen the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “Go and speak to Hananiah, saying, ‘This is what the LORD says: “You have broken the yokes of wood, but in their place you have made yokes of iron.” For this is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: “I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, to serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him. And I have also given him the animals of the field.” ’ ” Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah the prophet, “Listen now, Hananiah: the LORD has not sent you, and you have made this people trust in a lie. Therefore, this is what the LORD says: ‘Behold, I am going to remove you from the face of the earth. This year you are going to die, because you spoke falsely against the LORD.’ ”\nSo Hananiah the prophet died in the same year, in the seventh month.",

      "chapter_text": "Now these are the words of the letter which Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the rest of the elders of the exile, the priests, the prophets, and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon. (This was after King Jeconiah and the queen mother, the high officials, the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the metalworkers had departed from Jerusalem.) The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, saying, “This is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel, says to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: ‘Build houses and live in them; and plant gardens and eat their produce. Take wives and father sons and daughters, and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands, so that they may give birth to sons and daughters; and grow in numbers there and do not decrease. Seek the prosperity of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD in its behalf; for in its prosperity will be your prosperity.’ For this is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: ‘Do not let your prophets who are in your midst or your diviners deceive you, and do not listen to their interpretations of your dreams which you dream. For they prophesy falsely to you in My name; I have not sent them,’ declares the LORD.\n“For this is what the LORD says: ‘When seventy years have been completed for Babylon, I will visit you and fulfill My good word to you, to bring you back to this place. For I know the plans that I have for you,’ declares the LORD, ‘plans for prosperity and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope. Then you will call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. And you will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart. I will let Myself be found by you,’ declares the LORD, ‘and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and all the places where I have driven you,’ declares the LORD, ‘and I will bring you back to the place from where I sent you into exile.’\n“Because you have said, ‘The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon’— for this is what the LORD says concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who live in this city, your brothers who did not go with you into exile— this is what the LORD of armies says: ‘Behold, I am sending upon them the sword, famine, and plague; and I will make them like rotten figs that cannot be eaten due to rottenness. I will pursue them with the sword, with famine, and with plague; and I will make them an object of terror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse and an object of horror and hissing, and a disgrace among all the nations where I have driven them, because they have not listened to My words,’ declares the LORD, ‘which I sent to them again and again by My servants the prophets; but you did not listen,’ declares the LORD. ‘You, therefore, hear the word of the LORD, all you exiles, whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.\n‘This is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying to you falsely in My name: “Behold, I am going to hand them over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will kill them before your eyes. Because of them a curse will be used by all the exiles from Judah who are in Babylon, saying, ‘May the LORD make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,’ because they acted foolishly in Israel, and committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and falsely spoke words in My name which I did not command them. I am He who knows, and a witness,” declares the LORD.’ ”\nNow you shall speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying, “This is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: ‘Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to the priest Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, and to all the priests, saying, “The LORD has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, to be the overseer of the house of the LORD for every insane person who prophesies, to put him in the stocks and in the iron collar. So now, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who prophesies to you, seeing that he has sent word to us in Babylon, saying, ‘The exile will be long; build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their produce’ ?” ’ ”\nNow Zephaniah the priest read this letter to Jeremiah the prophet. Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, “Send word to all the exiles, saying, ‘This is what the LORD says concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: “Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, although I did not send him, and he has made you trust in a lie,” therefore this is what the LORD says: “Behold, I am going to punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants; he will not have anyone living among this people, and he will not see the good that I am going to do for My people,” declares the LORD, “because he has spoken falsely against the LORD.” ’ ”",

For I give plenty of water to the weary ones, and refresh everyone who languishes.” At this I awoke and looked, and my sleep had been pleasant to me.\n\n“Behold, days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of mankind and the seed of animals. And just as I have watched over them to uproot them, tear them down, ruin, destroy, and bring disaster on them, so I will watch over them to build and to plant them,” declares the LORD.\n“In those days they will no longer say,\n‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes,\nBut it is the children’s teeth that have become blunt.’\nBut everyone will die for his own wrongdoing; each person who eats the sour grapes, his own teeth will become blunt.\n“Behold, days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant which I made with their fathers on the day I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, although I was a husband to them,” declares the LORD. “For this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days,” declares the LORD: “I will put My law within them and write it on their heart; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people. They will not teach again, each one his neighbor and each one his brother, saying, ‘Know the LORD,’ for they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them,” declares the LORD, “for I will forgive their wrongdoing, and their sin I will no longer remember.”\n¶This is what the LORD says,\nHe who gives the sun for light by day\nAnd the fixed order of the moon and the stars for light by night,\nWho stirs up the sea so that its waves roar—\nThe LORD of armies is His name:\n“If this fixed order departs\nFrom Me,” declares the LORD,\n“Then the descendants of Israel also will cease\nTo be a nation before Me forever.”\nThis is what the LORD says:\n“If the heavens above can be measured\nAnd the foundations of the earth searched out below,\nThen I will also reject all the descendants of Israel\nFor everything that they have done,” declares the LORD.\n“Behold, days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when the city will be rebuilt for the LORD from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. The measuring line will go out farther straight ahead, to the hill Gareb; then it will turn to Goah. And the entire valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields as far as the brook Kidron to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east, shall be holy to the LORD; it will not be uprooted or overthrown ever again.”",

      "chapter_text": "The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. Now at that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was imprisoned in the courtyard of the guard, which was at the house of the king of Judah, because Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him, saying, “Why do you prophesy, saying, ‘This is what the LORD says: “Behold, I am going to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will take it; and Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, but he will certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon, and he will speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye. Then he will take Zedekiah to Babylon, and he will be there until I visit him,” declares the LORD. “If you fight against the Chaldeans, you will not succeed” ’?”\nAnd Jeremiah said, “The word of the LORD came to me, saying, ‘Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle is coming to you, saying, “Buy for yourself my field which is at Anathoth, for you have the right of redemption to buy it.” ’ Then my uncle’s son Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard in accordance with the word of the LORD and said to me, ‘Buy my field, please, that is at Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for you have the right of possession and the redemption is yours; buy it for yourself.’ Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.\n“So I bought the field which was in Anathoth from Hanamel my uncle’s son, and I weighed out the silver for him, seventeen shekels of silver. And I signed and sealed the deed, and called in witnesses, and weighed out the silver on the scales. Then I took the deeds of purchase, both the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions and the open copy; and I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the sight of Hanamel my uncle’s son and in the sight of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, in the sight of all the Jews who were sitting in the courtyard of the guard. And I commanded Baruch in their sight, saying, ‘This is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: “Take these deeds, this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware jar, so that they may last a long time.” For this is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: “Houses and fields and vineyards will again be purchased in this land.” ’\n\n“After giving the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD, saying, ‘Oh, Lord GOD! Behold, You Yourself have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm! Nothing is too difficult for You, who shows mercy to thousands, but repays the wrongdoing of fathers into the laps of their children after them, great and mighty God. The LORD of armies is His name; great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of mankind, giving to everyone according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds; who has accomplished signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and even to this day both in Israel and among mankind; and You have made a name for Yourself, as at this day. You brought Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders, and with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terror; and You gave them this land, which You swore to their forefathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey. They came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey Your voice or walk in Your Law; they did not do anything that You commanded them to do; therefore You have made all this disaster happen to them. Behold, the assault ramps have reached the city to take it; and the city has been handed over to the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, the famine, and the plague; and what You have spoken has come to pass; and behold, You see it. Yet You have said to me, Lord GOD, “Buy for yourself the field with money and call in witnesses”—although the city has been handed over to the Chaldeans.’ ”\nThen the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, “Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh; is anything too difficult for Me?” Therefore this is what the LORD says: “Behold, I am going to hand this city over to the Chaldeans and to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will take it. And the Chaldeans who are fighting against this city will enter and set this city on fire and burn it, with the houses where people have offered incense to Baal on their roofs and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke Me to anger. For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have been doing only evil in My sight since their youth; for the sons of Israel have been only provoking Me to anger by the work of their hands,” declares the LORD. “Indeed this city has been to Me a provocation of My anger and My wrath since the day that they built it, even to this day, so that it should be removed from My sight, because of all the evil of the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah which they have done to provoke Me to anger—they, their kings, their leaders, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. They have turned their back to Me and not their face; though I taught them, teaching again and again, they would not listen to accept discipline. But they put their detestable things in the house which is called by My name, to defile it. They built the high places of Baal that are in the Valley of Ben-hinnom to make their sons and their daughters pass through the fire to Molech, which I had not commanded them, nor had it entered My mind that they should do this abomination, to mislead Judah to sin.\n“Now therefore the LORD God of Israel says the following concerning this city of which you say, ‘It has been handed over to the king of Babylon by sword, by famine, and by plague’: Behold, I am going to gather them out of all the lands to which I have driven them in My anger, in My wrath, and in great indignation; and I will bring them back to this place and have them live in safety. They shall be My people, and I will be their God; and I will give them one heart and one way, so that they will fear Me always, for their own good and for the good of their children after them. I will make an everlasting covenant with them that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; and I will put the fear of Me in their hearts, so that they will not turn away from Me. I will rejoice over them to do them good and will faithfully plant them in this land with all My heart and all My soul.

And I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel, and will rebuild them as they were at first. And I will cleanse them from all their wrongdoing by which they have sinned against Me, and I will forgive all their wrongdoings by which they have sinned against Me and revolted against Me. It will be to Me a name of joy, praise, and glory before all the nations of the earth, which will hear of all the good that I do for them, and they will be frightened and tremble because of all the good and all the peace that I make for it.’\n“This is what the LORD says: ‘Yet again there will be heard in this place, of which you say, “It is a waste, without man and without animal,” that is, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are deserted, without man and without inhabitant and without animal, the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the groom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who say,\n“Give thanks to the LORD of armies,\nFor the LORD is good,\nFor His mercy is everlasting,”\nas they bring a thanksgiving offering into the house of the LORD. For I will restore the fortunes of the land as they were at first,’ says the LORD.\n“This is what the LORD of armies says: ‘There will again be in this place which is waste, without man or animal, and in all its cities, a pasture for shepherds who rest their flocks. In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, in the cities of the Negev, in the land of Benjamin, in the areas surrounding Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the flocks will again pass under the hands of the one who counts them,’ says the LORD.\n\n‘Behold, days are coming,’ declares the LORD, ‘when I will fulfill the good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and the house of Judah. In those days and at that time I will make a righteous Branch of David sprout; and He shall execute justice and righteousness on the earth. In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety; and this is the name by which it will be called: the LORD is our righteousness.’ For this is what the LORD says: ‘David shall not lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel; and the Levitical priests shall not lack a man before Me to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to prepare sacrifices continually.’ ”\nAnd the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, “This is what the LORD says: ‘If you can break My covenant for the day and My covenant for the night, so that day and night do not occur at their proper time, then My covenant with David My servant may also be broken, so that he will not have a son to reign on his throne, and with the Levitical priests, My ministers. As the heavenly lights cannot be counted, and the sand of the sea cannot be measured, so I will multiply the descendants of My servant David and the Levites who serve Me.’ ”\nAnd the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, “Have you not observed what these people have asserted, saying, ‘The two families which the LORD chose, He has rejected them’? So they despise My people as no longer being a nation in their sight. This is what the LORD says: ‘If My covenant for day and night does not continue, and I have not established the fixed patterns of heaven and earth, then I would reject the descendants of Jacob and David My servant, so as not to take from his descendants rulers over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But I will restore their fortunes and have mercy on them.’ ”",

This is what the LORD says concerning you: ‘You will not die by the sword. You will die in peace; and as spices were burned for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so they will burn spices for you; and they will mourn for you, crying, “Oh, my lord!” ’ For I have spoken the word,” declares the LORD.\nThen Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and all the remaining cities of Judah, that is, Lachish and Azekah, for they alone remained as fortified cities among the cities of Judah.\nThe word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were in Jerusalem, to proclaim release to them: that each person was to set his male servant free and each his female servant, a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, so that no one would keep them, his Jewish brother or sister, in bondage. And all the officials and all the people obeyed who had entered into the covenant that each person was to set his male servant free and each his female servant, so that no one would keep them in bondage any longer; they obeyed, and set them free. But afterward they turned around and took back the male servants and the female servants whom they had set free, and brought them into subjection as male servants and as female servants.\nThen the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel says: ‘I made a covenant with your forefathers on the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, saying, “At the end of seven years each of you shall set free his Hebrew brother who has been sold to you and has served you for six years, and you shall send him out free from you.” But your forefathers did not obey Me nor incline their ear to Me. Although recently you had turned and done what is right in My sight, each one proclaiming release to his neighbor, and you had made a covenant before Me in the house which is called by My name. Yet you turned and profaned My name, and each person took back his male servant and each his female servant whom you had set free according to their desire, and you brought them into subjection to be your male and female servants.’\n“Therefore this is what the LORD says: ‘You have not obeyed Me in proclaiming release, each one to his brother and each to his neighbor. Behold, I am proclaiming a release to you,’ declares the LORD, ‘to the sword, to the plague, and to the famine; and I will make you a terror to all the kingdoms of the earth. I will give the people who have violated My covenant, who have not fulfilled the words of the covenant which they made before Me, when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts— the officials of Judah and the officials of Jerusalem, the high officials and the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf— I will hand them over to their enemies and to those who seek their lives. And their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and the animals of the earth. Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials I will also hand over to their enemies and to those who seek their lives, and to the army of the king of Babylon which has withdrawn from you. Behold, I am going to give a command,’ declares the LORD, ‘and I will bring them back to this city, and they will fight against it and take it and burn it with fire; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant.’ ”",

Then I set before the men of the house of the Rechabites pitchers full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, “Drink wine!” But they said, “We will not drink wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, ‘You shall not drink wine, you or your sons, forever. You shall not build a house, and you shall not sow seed nor plant a vineyard, nor own one; but you shall live in tents all your days, so that you may live many days in the land where you live as strangers.’ And we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, not to drink wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters, nor to build ourselves houses to live in; and we do not have a vineyard, a field, or seed. But we have lived only in tents, and have obeyed and have done according to all that our father Jonadab commanded us. However, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, we said, ‘Come, and let’s go to Jerusalem away from the army of the Chaldeans and the army of the Arameans.’ So we have lived in Jerusalem.”\n\nThen the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, “This is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: ‘Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, “Will you not accept instruction by listening to My words?” declares the LORD. “The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab have been followed, which he commanded his sons: not to drink wine. And they do not drink wine to this day, for they have obeyed their father’s command. But I have spoken to you again and again, yet you have not listened to Me. Also I have sent to you all My servants the prophets, sending them again and again, saying: ‘Turn now every person from his evil way and amend your deeds, and do not follow other gods to worship them. Then you will live in the land which I have given to you and to your forefathers; but you have not inclined your ear or listened to Me. Indeed, the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have followed the command of their father which he commanded them, but this people has not listened to Me.’ ” ’ Therefore this is what the LORD says, the God of armies, the God of Israel: ‘Behold, I am bringing on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the disaster that I have pronounced against them; because I spoke to them but they did not listen, and I have called them but they did not answer.’ ”\nThen Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, “This is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: ‘Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your father, kept all his commands, and done according to all that he commanded you, therefore this is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: “Jonadab the son of Rechab will not lack a man to stand before Me always.” ’ ”",

      "chapter_text": "In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, “Take a scroll and write on it all the words which I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah, and all the nations, from the day I first spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, even to this day. Perhaps the house of Judah will listen to all the disaster which I plan to carry out against them, so that every person will turn from his evil way; then I will forgive their wrongdoing and their sin.”\nThen Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote on a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD which He had spoken to him. Jeremiah then commanded Baruch, saying, “I am restricted; I cannot go into the house of the LORD. So you go and read from the scroll, which you have written at my dictation, the words of the LORD to the people at the LORD’S house on a day of fasting. And you shall also read them to all the people of Judah who come from their cities. Perhaps their pleading will come before the LORD, and everyone will turn from his evil way; for great is the anger and the wrath that the LORD has pronounced against this people.” So Baruch the son of Neriah acted in accordance with all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading from the book the words of the LORD in the LORD’S house.\nNow in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the LORD. Then Baruch read to all the people from the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper courtyard, at the entry of the New Gate of the LORD’S house.\nNow when Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard all the words of the LORD from the book, he went down to the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber. And behold, all the officials were sitting there—Elishama the scribe, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the other officials. And Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read from the book to the people. Then all the officials sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, who was the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, “Take in your hand the scroll from which you have read to the people and come.” So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them. And they said to him, “Sit down, please, and read it to us.” So Baruch read it to them. When they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one to another. And they said to Baruch, “We will certainly report all these words to the king.” Then they asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us, please, how did you write all these words? Was it at Jeremiah’s dictation?” And Baruch said to them, “He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink on the book.” Then the officials said to Baruch, “Go, hide yourself, you and Jeremiah, and do not let anyone know where you are.”\n\nSo they came to the king in the courtyard, but they had deposited the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they reported all the words to the king. Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it to the king as well as to all the officials who were standing beside the king. Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month, with a fire burning in the brazier before him. And when Jehudi had read three or four columns, the king cut it with a scribe’s knife and threw it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all of the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier. Yet the king and all his servants who heard all these words did not tremble in fear, nor did they tear their garments. Even though Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them. And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but the LORD hid them.\n\nThen the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah after the king had burned the scroll and the words which Baruch had written at the dictation of Jeremiah, saying, “Take again another scroll and write on it all the previous words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah burned. And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, ‘This is what the LORD says: “You have burned this scroll, saying, ‘Why have you written on it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will make mankind and animals disappear from it?’ ” Therefore this is what the LORD says concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: “He shall have no one to sit on the throne of David, and his dead body shall be thrown out to the heat of the day and the frost of the night. I will also punish him, his descendants, and his servants for their wrongdoing, and I will bring on them and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the people of Judah all the disaster that I have declared to them—but they did not listen.” ’ ”\nThen Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch the son of Neriah, and he wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar words were added to them.",

But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the words of the LORD which He spoke through Jeremiah the prophet.\nYet King Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and the priest Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “Please pray to the LORD our God in our behalf.” Now Jeremiah was still coming and going among the people, for they had not yet put him in prison. Meanwhile, Pharaoh’s army had set out from Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who had been besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.\nThen the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel says: ‘This is what you are to say to the king of Judah, who sent you to Me to inquire of Me: “Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which has come out to help you, is going to return to its own land of Egypt. Then the Chaldeans will return and fight against this city, and they will capture it and burn it with fire.” ’ This is what the LORD says: ‘Do not deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans will certainly go away from us,” for they will not go. For even if you had defeated the entire army of Chaldeans who were fighting against you, and there were only wounded men left among them, each man in his tent, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.’ ”\n\nNow it happened when the army of the Chaldeans had withdrawn from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army, that Jeremiah left Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin in order to take possession of some property there among the people. While he was at the Gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah the son of Hananiah was there; and he arrested Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are deserting to the Chaldeans!” But Jeremiah said, “A lie! I am not deserting to the Chaldeans”; yet he would not listen to him. So Irijah arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials. Then the officials were angry at Jeremiah and they beat him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe, for they had made it into the prison. For Jeremiah had come into the dungeon, that is, the vaulted cell; and Jeremiah stayed there many days.\nNow King Zedekiah sent men and took him out; and in his palace the king secretly asked him and said, “Is there a word from the LORD?” And Jeremiah said, “There is!” Then he said, “You will be handed over to the king of Babylon!” Moreover, Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “In what way have I sinned against you, or your servants, or this people, that you have put me in prison? And where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land’? But now, please listen, my lord the king; please let my plea come before you and do not make me return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, so that I will not die there.” Then King Zedekiah gave a command, and they placed Jeremiah in custody in the courtyard of the guardhouse, and gave him a loaf of bread daily from the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guardhouse.",

Now in the cistern there was no water but only mud, and Jeremiah sank into the mud. But Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, while he was in the king’s palace, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the cistern. Now the king was sitting at the Gate of Benjamin; and Ebed-melech went out from the king’s palace and spoke to the king, saying, “My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet whom they have thrown into the cistern; and he will die right where he is because of the famine, for there is no more bread in the city.” Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, “Take thirty men from here under your authority and bring Jeremiah the prophet up from the cistern before he dies.” So Ebed-melech took the men under his authority and went into the king’s palace to a place beneath the storeroom, and took from there worn-out clothes and worn-out rags, and let them down by ropes into the cistern to Jeremiah. Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Now put these worn-out clothes and rags under your armpits under the ropes”; and Jeremiah did so. So they pulled Jeremiah out with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern, and Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guardhouse.\n\nThen King Zedekiah sent word and had Jeremiah the prophet brought to him at the third entrance that is in the house of the LORD; and the king said to Jeremiah, “I am going to ask you something; do not hide anything from me.” And Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, will you not certainly put me to death? Besides, if I give you advice, you will not listen to me.” But King Zedekiah swore to Jeremiah in secret, saying, “As the LORD lives, who made this life for us, I certainly will not put you to death, nor will I hand you over to these men who are seeking your life.”\nSo Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “This is what the LORD God of armies, the God of Israel says: ‘If you will indeed surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, then you will live, this city will not be burned with fire, and you and your household will survive. But if you do not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, then this city will be handed over to the Chaldeans; and they will burn it with fire, and you yourself will not escape from their hands.’ ” Then King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am in fear of the Jews who have deserted to the Chaldeans, for they may hand me over to them, and they will abuse me.” But Jeremiah said, “They will not turn you over. Please obey the LORD in what I am saying to you, so that it may go well for you and you may live. But if you keep refusing to surrender, this is the word which the LORD has shown me: ‘Behold, all of the women who have been left in the palace of the king of Judah are going to be brought out to the officers of the king of Babylon; and those women will say,\n“Your close friends\nHave misled and overpowered you;\nWhile your feet were sunk in the mire,\nThey turned back.”\nThey are also going to bring out all your wives and your sons to the Chaldeans, and you yourself will not escape from their hand, but will be seized by the hand of the king of Babylon, and this city will be burned with fire.’ ”\nThen Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no one know about these words, and you will not die. But if the officials hear that I have talked with you and come to you and say to you, ‘Tell us now what you said to the king and what the king said to you; do not hide it from us and we will not put you to death,’ then you are to say to them, ‘I was presenting my plea before the king, not to make me return to the house of Jonathan to die there.’ ” Then all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him. So he reported to them in accordance with all these words which the king had commanded; and they stopped speaking with him, since the conversation had not been overheard. So Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was captured.",

Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came in and sat down at the Middle Gate: Nergal-sar-ezer, Samgar-nebu, Sar-sekim the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, and all the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon. And when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, they fled and left the city at night by way of the king’s garden through the gate between the two walls; and he went out toward the Arabah. But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and they took him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him. Then the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes at Riblah; the king of Babylon also slaughtered all the nobles of Judah. He then blinded Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in shackles of bronze to bring him to Babylon. The Chaldeans also burned the king’s palace and the houses of the people with fire, and they tore down the walls of Jerusalem. And as for the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had deserted to him and the rest of the people who remained, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard took them into exile in Babylon. But some of the poorest people, who had nothing, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard left behind in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at that time.\n\nNow Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave orders regarding Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, saying, “Take him and look after him, and do not do anything harmful to him, but rather deal with him just as he tells you.” So Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard sent word, along with Nebushazban the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, and all the leading officers of the king of Babylon; they even sent word and took Jeremiah out of the courtyard of the guardhouse and entrusted him to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him home. So he stayed among the people.\nNow the word of the LORD had come to Jeremiah while he was confined in the courtyard of the guardhouse, saying, “Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, ‘This is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: “Behold, I am going to bring My words on this city for disaster and not for prosperity; and they will take place before you on that day. But I will save you on that day,” declares the LORD, “and you will not be handed over to the men of whom you are afraid. For I will assuredly rescue you, and you will not fall by the sword; but you will have your own life as plunder, because you have trusted in Me,” declares the LORD.’ ”",

Now the captain of the bodyguard had taken Jeremiah and said to him, “The LORD your God promised this disaster against this place; and the LORD has brought it and done just as He promised. Because you people sinned against the LORD and did not listen to His voice, this thing has happened to you. But now, behold, I am setting you free today from the chains that are on your hands. If you would prefer to come with me to Babylon, come along, and I will look after you; but if you would prefer not to come with me to Babylon, do not come. Look, the whole land is before you; go wherever it seems good and right for you to go.” As Jeremiah was still not going back, he said, “Go on back then to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the cities of Judah, and stay with him among the people; or else go anywhere it seems right for you to go.” So the captain of the bodyguard gave him a ration and a gift, and let him go. Then Jeremiah went to Mizpah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land.\nNow all the commanders of the forces that were in the field, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam over the land, and that he had put him in charge of the men, women, and children, those of the poorest of the land who had not been exiled to Babylon. So they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, along with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, both they and their men. Then Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, swore to them and to their men, saying, “Do not be afraid of serving the Chaldeans; stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon, so that it may go well for you. Now as for me, behold, I am going to stay in Mizpah to stand for you before the Chaldeans who come to us; but as for you, gather wine, summer fruit, and oil, and put them in your storage vessels, and live in your cities that you have taken over.” Likewise, also all the Jews who were in Moab and among the sons of Ammon and in Edom, and who were in all the other countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant for Judah, and that he had appointed over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan. Then all the Jews returned from all the places to which they had been scattered and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruit in great abundance.\nNow Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were in the field came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and said to him, “Are you well aware that Baalis the king of the sons of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam did not believe them. Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah in Mizpah, saying, “Let me go and kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no one will know! Why should he take your life, so that all the Jews who are gathered to you would be scattered and the remnant of Judah would perish?” But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “Do not do this thing, for you are telling a lie about Ishmael.”",

While they were eating bread together there in Mizpah, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him rose up, and struck and killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword and put to death the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land. Ishmael also struck and killed all the Jews who were with him, that is with Gedaliah in Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war.\nNow it happened on the next day after the killing of Gedaliah, when no one knew about it, that eighty men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria with their beards shaved off, their clothes torn, and their bodies gashed, having grain offerings and incense in their hands to bring to the house of the LORD. Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah left Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went; and as he met them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam!” Yet it turned out that as soon as they came inside the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them and threw them into the cistern. But ten men who were found among them said to Ishmael, “Do not put us to death, for we have supplies of wheat, barley, oil, and honey hidden in the field.” So he refrained and did not put them to death along with their companions.\nNow as for the cistern where Ishmael had thrown all the bodies of the men whom he had struck and killed because of Gedaliah, it was the one that King Asa had constructed on account of Baasha, king of Israel; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the dead. Then Ishmael took captive all the remnant of the people who were in Mizpah, the king’s daughters and all the people who were left in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard had put in the custody of Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and proceeded to cross over to the sons of Ammon.\n\nBut Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him heard about all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done. So they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and they found him by the large pool that is in Gibeon. Now as soon as all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him, they were joyful. So all the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah. But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the sons of Ammon. Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him took from Mizpah all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after he had struck and killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, that is, the men who were soldiers, the women, the children, and the high officials, whom he had brought back from Gibeon. And they went and stayed in Geruth Chimham, which is beside Bethlehem, in order to proceed into Egypt because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, since Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had struck and killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.",

      "chapter_text": "Then all the commanders of the forces, Johanan the son of Kareah, Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the small to the great approached and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Please let our pleading come before you, and pray for us to the LORD your God for all this remnant—since we have been left only a few out of many, just as your own eyes now see us— that the LORD your God will tell us the way in which we should walk, and the thing that we should do.” Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard you. Behold, I am going to pray to the LORD your God in accordance with your words; and I will tell you the whole message which the LORD gives you as an answer. I will not withhold a word from you.” Then they said to Jeremiah, “May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act in accordance with the whole message with which the LORD your God will send you to us. Whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, we will listen to the voice of the LORD our God to whom we are sending you, so that it may go well for us when we listen to the voice of the LORD our God.”\nNow at the end of ten days the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah. Then he called for Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him, and for all the people from the small to the great, and said to them, “This is what the LORD says, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your plea before Him: ‘If you will indeed stay in this land, then I will build you up and not tear you down, and I will plant you and not uproot you; for I will relent of the disaster that I have inflicted on you. Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you are now fearing; do not be afraid of him,’ declares the LORD, ‘for I am with you to save you and rescue you from his hand. I will also show you compassion, so that he will have compassion on you and restore you to your own soil. But if you are going to say, “We will not stay in this land,” so as not to listen to the voice of the LORD your God, saying, “No, but we will go to the land of Egypt, where we will not see war, or hear the sound of a trumpet, or hunger for bread, and we will stay there”; then in that case listen to the word of the LORD, you remnant of Judah. This is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: “If you really set your minds to enter Egypt and go in to reside there, then the sword, of which you are afraid, will overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, about which you are anxious, will follow closely after you there in Egypt, and you will die there. So all the people who set their minds to go to Egypt to reside there will die by the sword, by famine, or by plague; and they will have no refugees or survivors from the disaster that I am going to bring on them.” ’ ”\nFor this is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: “As My anger and wrath have gushed out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so My wrath will gush out on you when you enter Egypt. And you will become a curse, an object of horror, an imprecation, and a disgrace; and you will not see this place again.” The LORD has spoken to you, you remnant of Judah, “Do not go to Egypt!” You know for certain that I have admonished you today. For you have only deceived yourselves; for it is you who sent me to the LORD your God, saying, “Pray for us to the LORD our God; and whatever the LORD our God says, tell us so, and we will do it.” So I have told you today, but you have not obeyed the LORD your God in whatever He has sent me to tell you. And now you shall know for certain that you will die by the sword, by famine, or by plague in the place where you desire to go to reside.",

The LORD our God has not sent you to say, ‘You are not to enter Egypt to reside there’; but Baruch the son of Neriah is inciting you against us in order to hand us over to the Chaldeans, so they will put us to death or exile us to Babylon!” So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces, and all the people, did not obey the voice of the LORD to stay in the land of Judah. Instead, Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took the entire remnant of Judah who had returned from all the nations to which they had been scattered, in order to reside in the land of Judah— the men, the women, the children, the king’s daughters, and every person whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, together with Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah— and they entered the land of Egypt (for they did not obey the voice of the LORD) and went in as far as Tahpanhes.\nThen the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, “Take some large stones in your hands and hide them in the mortar in the brick terrace which is at the entrance of Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes, in the sight of some of the Jews; and say to them, ‘This is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: “Behold, I am going to send men and get My servant Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and I am going to set his throne over these stones that I have hidden; and he will spread his canopy over them. He will also come and strike the land of Egypt; those who are meant for death will be given over to death, and those for captivity to captivity, and those for the sword to the sword. And I shall set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt, and he will burn them and take them captive. So he will wrap himself with the land of Egypt as a shepherd wraps himself with his garment, and he will depart from there safely. He will also smash to pieces the obelisks of Heliopolis, which is in the land of Egypt; and the temples of the gods of Egypt he will burn with fire.” ’ ”",

      "chapter_text": "The word that came to Jeremiah for all the Jews living in the land of Egypt, those who were living in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and the land of Pathros, saying, “This is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: ‘You yourselves have seen all the disaster that I have brought on Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah; and behold, this day they are in ruins and no one lives in them, because of their wickedness which they committed to provoke Me to anger by continuing to burn sacrifices and to serve other gods whom they had not known, neither they, you, nor your fathers. Yet I sent you all My servants the prophets again and again, saying, “Oh, do not do this abominable thing which I hate.” But they did not listen or incline their ears to turn from their wickedness, so as not to burn sacrifices to other gods. Therefore My wrath and My anger gushed out and burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, so they have become ruins and a desolation as it is this day. Now then, this is what the LORD God of armies, the God of Israel says: “Why are you doing great harm to yourselves, to eliminate from yourselves man and woman, child and infant from among Judah, leaving yourselves without a remnant, provoking Me to anger with the works of your hands, burning sacrifices to other gods in the land of Egypt where you are entering to reside, so that you may be eliminated and become a curse and a disgrace among all the nations of the earth? Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of the kings of Judah and the wickedness of their wives, your own wickedness and the wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? Yet they have not become contrite even to this day, nor have they feared, nor walked in My Law or My statutes, which I placed before you and before your fathers.” ’\n“Therefore this is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: ‘Behold, I am going to set My face against you for a disaster, even to eliminate all Judah. And I will take away the remnant of Judah who have set their minds on entering the land of Egypt to reside there, and they will all meet their end in the land of Egypt; they will fall by the sword or meet their end by famine. From the small to the great, they will die by the sword and famine; and they will become a curse, an object of horror, an imprecation, and a disgrace. And I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt, just as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with famine, and with plague. So there will be no survivor or refugee for the remnant of Judah who have entered the land of Egypt to reside there and then to return to the land of Judah, to which they are longing to return to live; for none will return except a few refugees.’ ”\nThen all the men who were aware that their wives were burning sacrifices to other gods, along with all the women who were standing by, as a large assembly, including all the people who were living in Pathros in the land of Egypt, responded to Jeremiah, saying, “As for the message that you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we are not going to listen to you! But we will certainly carry out every word that has proceeded from our mouths, by burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, just as we ourselves, our forefathers, our kings, and our leaders did in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then we had plenty of food and were well off and saw no misfortune. But since we stopped burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything, and have met our end by the sword and by famine.” “And,” said the women, “when we were burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, was it without our husbands that we made for her sacrificial cakes in her image, and poured out drink offerings to her?”\n\nThen Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and women—even to all the people who were giving him such an answer—saying, “As for the smoking sacrifices that you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your forefathers, your kings and your leaders, and the people of the land, did the LORD not remember them, and did all of this not come into His mind? So the LORD was no longer able to endure it, because of the evil of your deeds, because of the abominations which you have committed; so your land has become a place of ruins, an object of horror, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as it is this day. Since you have burned sacrifices and have sinned against the LORD and not obeyed the voice of the LORD nor walked in His Law, His statutes, or His testimonies, therefore this disaster has happened to you, as it has this day.”\nThen Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, “Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt! This is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: ‘As for you and your wives, you have spoken with your mouths and fulfilled it with your hands, saying, “We will certainly perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her.” By all means fulfill your vows, and be sure to perform your vows!’ In return, hear the word of the LORD, all Judah who are living in the land of Egypt: ‘Behold, I have sworn by My great name,’ says the LORD, ‘that My name shall never be invoked again by the mouth of anyone of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, “As the Lord GOD lives.” Behold, I am watching over them for harm and not for good, and all the people of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will meet their end by the sword or by famine until they are completely gone. Those who escape the sword will return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah few in number.

I shall hand them over to those who are seeking their lives, that is, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to his officers. Afterward, however, it will be inhabited as in the days of old,” declares the LORD.\n¶“But as for you, Jacob My servant, do not fear,\nNor be dismayed, Israel!\nFor, see, I am going to save you from far away,\nAnd your descendants from the land of their captivity;\nAnd Jacob will return and be undisturbed\nAnd secure, with no one making him afraid.\n“Jacob My servant, do not fear,” declares the LORD,\n“For I am with you.\nFor I will make a complete destruction of all the nations\nWhere I have driven you,\nYet I will not make a complete destruction of you;\nBut I will correct you properly\nAnd by no means leave you unpunished.”",

      "chapter_text": "Concerning Moab. This is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says:\n“Woe to Nebo, for it has been destroyed;\nKiriathaim has been put to shame, it has been captured;\nThe high stronghold has been put to shame and shattered.\n“There is no longer praise for Moab;\nIn Heshbon they have devised disaster against her:\n‘Come and let’s cut her off from being a nation!’\nYou too, Madmen, will be silenced;\nThe sword will follow you.\n“The sound of an outcry from Horonaim,\n‘Devastation and great destruction!’\n“Moab is broken,\nHer little ones have sounded out a cry of distress.\n“For they will go up by the ascent of Luhith\nWith continual weeping;\nFor at the descent of Horonaim\nThey have heard the anguished cry of destruction.\n“Flee, save yourselves,\nSo that you may be like a juniper in the wilderness.\n“For because of your trust in your own achievements and treasures,\nYou yourself will also be captured;\nAnd Chemosh will go off into exile\nTogether with his priests and his leaders.\n“A destroyer will come to every city,\nSo that no city will escape;\nThe valley also will be ruined\nAnd the plateau will be destroyed,\nAs the LORD has said.\n“Give wings to Moab,\nFor she will flee away;\nAnd her cities will become a desolation,\nWithout inhabitants in them.\n“Cursed is the one who does the LORD’S work negligently,\nAnd cursed is the one who restrains his sword from blood.\n¶“Moab has been at ease since his youth;\nHe has also been peaceful, like wine on its dregs,\nAnd he has not been poured from vessel to vessel,\nNor has he gone into exile.\nTherefore he retains his flavor,\nAnd his aroma has not changed.\nTherefore behold, the days are coming,” declares the LORD, “when I will send to him those who tip vessels, and they will tip him over, and they will pour out his vessels and smash his jars. And Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh, just as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence.\n“How can you say, ‘We are warriors,\nAnd men competent for battle’?\n“Moab has been destroyed and men have gone up to his cities;\nHis choicest young men have also gone down to the slaughter,”\nDeclares the King, whose name is the LORD of armies.\n“The disaster of Moab will soon come,\nAnd his catastrophe has hurried quickly.\n“Mourn for him, all you who live around him,\nAnd all of you who know his name;\nSay, ‘How the mighty scepter has been broken,\nA staff of splendor!’\n“Come down from your glory\nAnd sit on the parched ground,\nO daughter living in Dibon,\nFor the destroyer of Moab has come up against you,\nHe has ruined your strongholds.\n“Stand by the road and keep watch,\nYou inhabitant of Aroer;\nAsk him who flees and her who escapes\nAnd say, ‘What has happened?’\n“Moab has been put to shame, for it has been shattered.\nWail and cry out;\nDeclare by the Arnon\nThat Moab has been destroyed.\n“Judgment has also come upon the plain, upon Holon, Jahzah, and against Mephaath, against Dibon, Nebo, and Beth-diblathaim, against Kiriathaim, Beth-gamul, and Beth-meon, against Kerioth, Bozrah, and all the cities of the land of Moab, far and near. The horn of Moab has been cut off, and his arm broken,” declares the LORD. “Make him drunk, for he has become arrogant toward the LORD; so Moab will vomit, and he also will become a laughingstock. Now was Israel not a laughingstock to you? Or was he caught among thieves? For whenever you speak about him you shake your head in scorn.\n“Leave the cities and live among the rocky cliffs,\nYou inhabitants of Moab,\nAnd be like a dove that nests\nBeyond the mouth of the chasm.\n“We have heard of the pride of Moab—he is very proud—\nOf his haughtiness, his pride, his arrogance, and his self-exaltation.\n“I know his fury,” declares the LORD,\n“But it is futile;\nHis idle boasts have accomplished nothing.\n“Therefore I will wail for Moab,\nFor all of Moab I will cry out;\nI will moan for the men of Kir-heres.\n“More than the weeping for Jazer\nI will weep for you, O vine of Sibmah!\nYour tendrils stretched across the sea,\nThey reached to the sea of Jazer;\nUpon your summer fruits and your grape harvest\nThe destroyer has fallen.\n“So joy and rejoicing are removed\nFrom the fruitful field, and from the land of Moab.\nAnd I have eliminated the wine from the wine presses;\nNo one will tread them with shouting,\nThe shouting will not be shouts of joy.\nFrom the outcry at Heshbon to Elealeh, to Jahaz they have raised their voice, from Zoar to Horonaim, and to Eglath-shelishiyah; for even the waters of Nimrim will become desolate. And I will put an end to Moab,” declares the LORD, “the one who offers sacrifice on the high place and the one who burns incense to his gods.\n“Therefore My heart makes a sound like flutes for Moab; My heart also makes a sound like flutes for the men of Kir-heres. Therefore they have lost the abundance it produced. For every head is shaved bald, and every beard cut short; there are gashes on all the hands, and sackcloth around the waists. On all the housetops of Moab and in its public squares there is mourning everywhere; for I have broken Moab like an undesirable vessel,” declares the LORD. “How shattered it is! How they have wailed! How Moab has turned his back—he is ashamed! So Moab will become a laughingstock and an object of terror to all around him.”\n¶For this is what the LORD says:\n“Behold, one will fly swiftly like an eagle\nAnd spread out his wings against Moab.\n“Kerioth has been captured\nAnd the strongholds have been seized,\nSo the hearts of the warriors of Moab on that day\nWill be like the heart of a woman in labor.\n“Moab will be destroyed from being a people\nBecause he has become arrogant toward the LORD.\n“Terror, pit, and snare are coming upon you,\nInhabitant of Moab,” declares the LORD.\n“The one who flees from the terror\nWill fall into the pit,\nAnd the one who climbs up out of the pit\nWill be caught in the snare;\nFor I will bring upon her, upon Moab,\nThe year of their punishment,” declares the LORD.\n¶“In the shadow of Heshbon\nThe fugitives stand without strength;\nFor a fire has spread out from Heshbon\nAnd a flame from the midst of Sihon,\nAnd it has devoured the forehead of Moab\nAnd the scalps of the loud revelers.\n“Woe to you, Moab!\nThe people of Chemosh have perished;\nFor your sons have been taken away captive,\nAnd your daughters into captivity.\n“Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab\nIn the latter days,” declares the LORD.\nT his is the extent of the judgment on Moab.",

This is what the LORD says:\n“Does Israel have no sons?\nOr has he no heirs?\nWhy then has Malcam taken possession of Gad,\nAnd his people settled in its cities?\n“Therefore behold, the days are coming,” declares the LORD,\n“When I will cause an alarm of war to be heard\nAgainst Rabbah of the sons of Ammon;\nAnd it will become a desolate heap,\nAnd her towns will be set on fire.\nThen Israel will take possession of his possessors,”\nSays the LORD.\n“Wail, Heshbon, for Ai has been destroyed!\nCry out, daughters of Rabbah,\nPut on sackcloth and mourn,\nAnd move about inside the walls;\nFor Malcam will go into exile\nTogether with his priests and his leaders.\n“How you boast about the valleys!\nYour valley is flowing away,\nYou backsliding daughter\nWho trusts in her treasures, saying,\n‘Who can come against me?’\n“Behold, I am going to bring terror upon you,”\nDeclares the Lord GOD of armies,\n“From all directions around you;\nAnd you will be driven away one after another,\nWith no one to gather the fugitives together.\n“But afterward I will restore\nThe fortunes of the sons of Ammon,”\nDeclares the LORD.\n\n¶Concerning Edom.\nThis is what the LORD of armies says:\n“Is there no longer any wisdom in Teman?\nHas good advice been lost by the prudent?\nHas their wisdom decayed?\n“Flee away, turn back, dwell in the depths,\nYou inhabitants of Dedan,\nFor I will bring the disaster of Esau upon him\nAt the time I punish him.\n“If grape pickers came to you,\nWould they not leave gleanings?\nIf thieves came by night,\nThey would destroy only what was sufficient for them.\n“But I have stripped Esau bare,\nI have uncovered his hiding places\nSo that he will not be able to conceal himself;\nHis offspring have been destroyed along with his brothers\nAnd his neighbors, and he no longer exists.\n“Leave your orphans behind, I will keep them alive;\nAnd let your widows trust in Me.”\nFor this is what the LORD says: “Behold, those who were not sentenced to drink the cup will certainly drink it, so are you the one who will be held completely blameless? You will not be held blameless, but you will certainly drink it. For I have sworn by Myself,” declares the LORD, “that Bozrah will become an object of horror, a disgrace, a wasteland, and a curse; and all its cities will become permanent ruins.”\n¶I have heard a message from the LORD,\nAnd a messenger is being sent among the nations, saying,\n“Gather yourselves together and come against her,\nAnd rise up for battle!”\n“For behold, I have made you small among the nations,\nDespised among people.\n“As for the terror you cause,\nThe arrogance of your heart has deceived you,\nYou who live in the clefts of the rock,\nWho occupy the height of the hill.\nThough you make your nest as high as an eagle’s,\nI will bring you down from there,” declares the LORD.\n“Edom will become an object of horror; everyone who passes by it will be appalled and will hiss at all its wounds. Like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah with its neighbors,” says the LORD, “no one will live there, nor will anyone of mankind reside in it. Behold, one will come up like a lion from the thicket of the Jordan to a perennially watered pasture; for in an instant I will chase him away from it, and I will appoint over it whoever is chosen. For who is like Me, and who will summon Me into court? And who then is the shepherd who can stand against Me?”\nTherefore hear the plan of the LORD which He has planned against Edom, and His purposes which He has in mind against the inhabitants of Teman: they will certainly drag them off, even the little ones of the flock; He will certainly make their pasture desolate because of them. The earth has quaked at the noise of their downfall. There is an outcry! The noise of it has been heard at the Red Sea. Behold, He will mount up and swoop like an eagle, and spread out His wings against Bozrah; and the hearts of the warriors of Edom on that day will be like the heart of a woman in labor.\n\n¶Concerning Damascus:\n“Hamath and Arpad are put to shame,\nFor they have heard bad news;\nThey despair.\nThere is anxiety at the sea,\nIt cannot be calmed.\n“Damascus has become helpless;\nShe has turned away to flee,\nAnd panic has gripped her;\nDistress and labor pains have seized her\nLike a woman in childbirth.\n“How the city of praise has not been deserted,\nThe town of My joy!\n“Therefore, her young men will fall in her streets,\nAnd all the men of war will perish on that day,” declares the LORD of armies.\n“I will set fire to the wall of Damascus,\nAnd it will devour the fortified palace of Ben-hadad.”\n\nConcerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated. This is what the LORD says:\n“Arise, go up to Kedar\nAnd devastate the people of the east.\n“They will take away their tents and their flocks;\nThey will carry off for themselves\nTheir tent curtains, all their goods and their camels,\nAnd they will call out to one another, ‘Horror on every side!’\n“Run away, flee! Dwell in the depths,\nYou inhabitants of Hazor,” declares the LORD;\n“For Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has formed a plan against you\nAnd devised a scheme against you.\n“Arise, go up against a nation which is at ease,\nWhich lives securely,” declares the LORD.\n“It has no gates or bars;\nThey dwell alone.\n“Their camels will become plunder,\nAnd their many livestock for spoils,\nAnd I will scatter to all the winds those who cut the corners of their hair;\nAnd I will bring their disaster from every side,” declares the LORD.\n“Hazor will become a haunt of jackals,\nA desolation forever;\nNo one will live there,\nNor will anyone of mankind reside in it.”\n\nThe word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying:\n¶“This is what the LORD of armies says:\n‘Behold, I am going to break the bow of Elam,\nThe finest of their might.\n‘I will bring upon Elam the four winds\nFrom the four ends of heaven,\nAnd will scatter them to all these winds;\nAnd there will be no nation\nTo which the outcasts of Elam will not go.\n‘So I will shatter Elam before their enemies\nAnd before those who seek their lives;\nAnd I will bring disaster upon them,\nEven My fierce anger,’ declares the LORD,\n‘And I will send the sword after them\nUntil I have consumed them.\n‘Then I will set My throne in Elam,\nAnd eliminate from there the king and officials,’\nDeclares the LORD.\n‘But it will come about in the last days\nThat I will restore the fortunes of Elam,’ ”\nDeclares the LORD.",

Say,\n‘Babylon has been captured,\nBel has been put to shame, Marduk has been shattered;\nHer idols have been put to shame, her images have been shattered.’\nFor a nation has come up against her from the north; it will make her land an object of horror, and there will be no inhabitant in it. Whether people or animals, they have wandered off, they have gone!\n“In those days and at that time,” declares the LORD, “the sons of Israel will come, they and the sons of Judah as well; they will go along weeping as they go, and it will be the LORD their God whom they will seek. They will ask for the way to Zion, turning their faces in its direction; they will come so that they may join themselves to the LORD in an everlasting covenant that will not be forgotten.\n¶“My people have become lost sheep;\nTheir shepherds have led them astray.\nThey have made them turn aside on the mountains.\nThey have gone from mountain to hill,\nThey have forgotten their resting place.\n“All who found them have devoured them;\nAnd their adversaries have said, ‘We are not guilty,\nSince they have sinned against the LORD who is the habitation of righteousness,\nThe LORD, the hope of their fathers.’\n¶“Wander away from the midst of Babylon\nAnd go out from the land of the Chaldeans;\nBe like male goats at the head of the flock.\n“For behold, I am going to rouse and bring up against Babylon\nA contingent of great nations from the land of the north,\nAnd they will draw up their battle lines against her;\nFrom there she will be taken captive.\nTheir arrows will be like an expert warrior\nWho does not return empty-handed.\n“Chaldea will become plunder;\nAll who plunder her will have enough,” declares the LORD.\n¶“Because you are glad, because you are jubilant,\nYou who pillage My heritage,\nBecause you skip about like a threshing heifer\nAnd neigh like stallions,\nYour mother will be greatly ashamed,\nShe who gave you birth will be humiliated.\nBehold, she will be the least of the nations,\nA wilderness, a dry land and a desert.\n“Because of the wrath of the LORD she will not be inhabited,\nBut she will be completely desolate;\nEveryone who passes by Babylon will be horrified\nAnd will hiss because of all her wounds.\n“Draw up your battle lines against Babylon on every side,\nAll of you who bend the bow;\nShoot at her, do not spare your arrows,\nFor she has sinned against the LORD.\n“Raise your battle cry against her on every side!\nShe has given herself up, her towers have fallen,\nHer walls have been torn down.\nFor this is the vengeance of the LORD:\nTake vengeance on her;\nAs she has done to others, so do to her.\n“Eliminate the sower from Babylon\nAnd the one who wields the sickle at the time of harvest;\nFrom the sword of the oppressor\nEach of them will turn back to his own people\nAnd each of them will flee to his own land.\n“Israel is a scattered flock, the lions have driven them away. The first one who devoured him was the king of Assyria, and this last one who has gnawed his bones is Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. Therefore this is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says: ‘Behold, I am going to punish the king of Babylon and his land, just as I punished the king of Assyria. And I will bring Israel back to his pasture and he will graze on Carmel and Bashan, and his desire will be satisfied in the hill country of Ephraim and Gilead. In those days and at that time,’ declares the LORD, ‘search will be made for the wrongdoing of Israel, but there will be none; and for the sins of Judah, but they will not be found; for I will forgive those whom I leave as a remnant.’\n¶“Against the land of Merathaim, go up against it,\nAnd against the inhabitants of Pekod.\nKill and completely destroy them,” declares the LORD,\n“And do according to everything that I have commanded you.\n“The noise of battle is in the land,\nAnd great destruction.\n“How the hammer of the whole earth\nHas been cut off and broken!\nHow Babylon has become\nAn object of horror among the nations!\n“I set a trap for you and you were also caught, Babylon,\nWhile you yourself were not aware;\nYou have been found and also seized\nBecause you have engaged in conflict with the LORD.”\nThe LORD has opened His armory\nAnd has brought out the weapons of His indignation,\nFor it is a work of the Lord GOD of armies\nIn the land of the Chaldeans.\nCome to her from the farthest border;\nOpen up her barns,\nPile her up like heaps of grain\nAnd completely destroy her,\nLet nothing be left to her.\nPut all her bulls to the sword;\nLet them go down to the slaughter!\nWoe be upon them, for their day has come,\nThe time of their punishment.\n¶There is a sound of fugitives and refugees from the land of Babylon,\nTo declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God,\nVengeance for His temple.\n¶“Summon many against Babylon,\nAll those who bend the bow:\nEncamp against her on every side,\nLet there be no escape.\nRepay her according to her work;\nAccording to all that she has done, so do to her;\nFor she has become arrogant against the LORD,\nAgainst the Holy One of Israel.\n“Therefore her young men will fall in her streets,\nAnd all her men of war will perish on that day,” declares the LORD.\n“Behold, I am against you, arrogant one,”\nDeclares the Lord GOD of armies,\n“For your day has come,\nThe time when I will punish you.\n“The arrogant one will stumble and fall\nWith no one to raise him up;\nAnd I will set fire to his cities,\nAnd it will devour all his surroundings.”\n¶This is what the LORD of armies says:\n“The sons of Israel are oppressed,\nAnd the sons of Judah as well;\nAnd all who took them captive have held them firmly,\nThey have refused to let them go.\n“Their Redeemer is strong, the LORD of armies is His name;\nHe will vigorously plead their case\nSo that He may bring rest to their land,\nBut turmoil to the inhabitants of Babylon.\n“A sword against the Chaldeans,” declares the LORD,\n“And against the inhabitants of Babylon\nAnd against her leaders and her wise men!\n“A sword against the oracle priests, and they will become fools!\nA sword against her warriors, and they will be shattered!\n“A sword against their horses, against their chariots,\nAnd against all the foreigners who are in the midst of her,\nAnd they will become women!\nA sword against her treasures, and they will be plundered!\n“A drought on her waters, and they will be dried up!\nFor it is a land of idols,\nAnd they go insane at frightful images.\n¶“Therefore the desert creatures will live there with the jackals;\nThe ostriches also will live in it.\nIt will never again be inhabited\nNor lived in from generation to generation.\n“As when God overthrew Sodom\nAnd Gomorrah with its neighbors,” declares the LORD,\n“No one will live there,\nNor will anyone of mankind reside in it.\n¶“Behold, a people is coming from the north,\nAnd a great nation and many kings\nWill be roused from the remote parts of the earth.\n“They seize their bow and javelin;\nThey are cruel and have no mercy.\nTheir voice roars like the sea;\nAnd they ride on horses,\nDrawn up like a man for the battle\nAgainst you, daughter of Babylon.\n“The king of Babylon has heard the report about them,\nAnd his hands hang limp;\nDistress has gripped him,\nAgony like a woman in childbirth.\n“Behold, one will come up like a lion from the thicket of the Jordan to a perennially watered pasture; for in an instant I will chase them away from it, and I will appoint over it whoever is chosen. For who is like Me, and who will summon Me into court? And who then is the shepherd who can stand against Me?” Therefore hear the plan of the LORD which He has planned against Babylon, and His purposes which He has in mind against the land of the Chaldeans: they will certainly drag them off, even the little ones of the flock; He will certainly make their pasture desolate because of them. At the shout, “Babylon has been conquered!” the earth quakes, and an outcry is heard among the nations.",

Babylon so that they may winnow her\nAnd devastate her land;\nFor they will be opposed to her on every side\nOn the day of her disaster.\n“Let not him who bends his bow bend it,\nNor let him rise up in his coat of armor.\nDo not spare her young men;\nDevote all her army to destruction.\n“They will fall down dead in the land of the Chaldeans,\nAnd pierced through in their streets.”\n¶For neither Israel nor Judah has been forsaken\nBy his God, the LORD of armies,\nAlthough their land is full of guilt\nBefore the Holy One of Israel.\nFlee from the midst of Babylon,\nAnd each of you save his life!\nDo not perish in her punishment,\nFor this is the LORD’S time of vengeance;\nHe is going to repay to her what she deserves.\nBabylon has been a golden cup in the hand of the LORD,\nIntoxicating all the earth.\nThe nations have drunk of her wine;\nTherefore the nations are going insane.\nSuddenly Babylon has fallen and been broken;\nWail over her!\nBring balm for her pain;\nPerhaps she may be healed.\nWe applied healing to Babylon, but she was not healed;\nAbandon her and let’s each go to his own country,\nFor her judgment has reached to heaven\nAnd it rises to the clouds.\nThe LORD has brought about our vindication;\nCome and let’s recount in Zion\nThe work of the LORD our God!\n¶Sharpen the arrows, fill the quivers!\nThe LORD has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes,\nBecause His plan is against Babylon to destroy it;\nFor it is the vengeance of the LORD, vengeance for His temple.\nLift up a signal flag against the walls of Babylon;\nPost a strong guard,\nStation sentries,\nSet up an ambush!\nFor the LORD has both planned and performed\nWhat He spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.\nYou who live by many waters,\nAbundant in treasures,\nYour end has come,\nThe measure of your end.\nThe LORD of armies has sworn by Himself:\n“I will certainly fill you with a population like locusts,\nAnd they will cry out with shouts of victory over you.”\n¶It is He who made the earth by His power,\nWho established the world by His wisdom,\nAnd by His understanding He stretched out the heavens.\nWhen He utters His voice, there is a roar of waters in the heavens,\nAnd He makes the clouds ascend from the end of the earth.\nHe makes lightning for the rain\nAnd brings out wind from His storehouses.\nEvery person is stupid, devoid of knowledge;\nEvery goldsmith is put to shame by his idols,\nFor his cast metal images are deceitful,\nAnd there is no breath in them.\nThey are worthless, a work of mockery;\nAt the time of their punishment they will perish.\nThe portion of Jacob is not like these;\nFor He is the Maker of everything,\nAnd of the tribe of His inheritance;\nThe LORD of armies is His name.\nHe says, “You are My war-club, My weapon of war;\nAnd with you I shatter nations,\nAnd with you I destroy kingdoms.\n“With you I shatter the horse and his rider,\nAnd with you I shatter the chariot and its rider,\nAnd with you I shatter man and woman,\nAnd with you I shatter the old man and youth,\nAnd with you I shatter the young man and virgin,\nAnd with you I shatter the shepherd and his flock,\nAnd with you I shatter the farmer and his team,\nAnd with you I shatter governors and officials.\n“But I will repay Babylon and all the inhabitants of Chaldea for all their evil that they have done in Zion before your eyes,” declares the LORD.\n“Behold, I am against you, mountain of destruction\nThat destroys the whole earth,” declares the LORD,\n“And I will stretch out My hand against you,\nAnd roll you down from the rocky cliffs,\nAnd I will make you a burnt out mountain.\n“They will not take from you even a stone for a corner\nNor a stone for foundations,\nBut you will be desolate forever,” declares the LORD.\n¶Lift up a signal flag in the land,\nBlow a trumpet among the nations!\nConsecrate the nations against her,\nSummon against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz;\nAppoint an officer against her,\nBring up the horses like bristly locusts.\nConsecrate the nations against her,\nThe kings of the Medes,\nTheir governors and all their officials,\nAnd every land under their control.\nSo the land quakes and writhes,\nFor the plans of the LORD against Babylon stand,\nTo make the land of Babylon\nA desolation without inhabitants.\nThe warriors of Babylon have ceased fighting,\nThey stay in the strongholds;\nTheir strength is exhausted,\nThey are becoming like women;\nTheir homes are set on fire,\nThe bars of her gates are broken.\nOne courier runs to meet another,\nAnd one messenger to meet another,\nTo tell the king of Babylon\nThat his city has been captured from end to end;\nThe river crossing places have been seized,\nAnd they have burned the marshes with fire,\nAnd the men of war are terrified.\n¶For this is what the LORD of armies, the God of Israel says:\n“The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor\nAt the time that it is tread down;\nIn just a little while the time of harvest will come for her.”\n¶“Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me, he has crushed me,\nHe has set me down like an empty vessel;\nHe has swallowed me like a monster,\nHe has filled his stomach with my delicacies;\nHe has washed me away.\n“May the violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon,”\nThe inhabitant of Zion will say;\nAnd, “May my blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea,”\nJerusalem will say.\nTherefore this is what the LORD says:\n“Behold, I am going to plead your case\nAnd take vengeance for you;\nAnd I will dry up her sea\nAnd make her fountain dry.\n“Babylon will become a heap of ruins, a haunt of jackals,\nAn object of horror and hissing, without inhabitants.\n“They will roar together like young lions,\nThey will growl like lions’ cubs.\n“When they become heated up, I will serve them their banquet\nAnd make them drunk, so that they may rejoice in triumph,\nAnd may sleep a perpetual sleep\nAnd not wake up,” declares the LORD.\n“I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter,\nLike rams together with male goats.\n¶“How Sheshak has been captured,\nAnd the praise of the whole earth has been seized!\nHow Babylon has become an object of horror among the nations!\n“The sea has come up over Babylon;\nShe has been engulfed by its roaring waves.\n“Her cities have become an object of horror,\nA dry land and a desert,\nA land in which no one lives\nAnd through which no one of mankind passes.\n“I will punish Bel in Babylon,\nAnd I will make what he has swallowed come out of his mouth;\nAnd the nations will no longer stream toward him.\nEven the wall of Babylon has fallen down!\n¶“Come out from her midst, My people,\nAnd each of you save yourselves\nFrom the fierce anger of the LORD.\n“Now, so that your heart does not grow faint,\nAnd you are not afraid at the report that will be heard in the land—\nFor the report will come in one year,\nAnd after that another report in another year,\nAnd violence will be in the land\nWith ruler against ruler—\nTherefore behold, days are coming\nWhen I will punish the idols of Babylon;\nAnd her whole land will be put to shame.\nAnd all her slain will fall in her midst.\n“Then heaven and earth and everything that is in them\nWill shout for joy over Babylon,\nBecause the destroyers will come to her from the north,”\nDeclares the LORD.\n¶Indeed, Babylon is to fall for the slain of Israel,\nAs the slain of all the earth have also fallen for Babylon.\nYou who have escaped the sword,\nGo! Do not stay!\nRemember the LORD from far away,\nAnd let Jerusalem come to your mind.\nWe are ashamed because we have heard rebuke;\nDisgrace has covered our faces,\nBecause strangers have entered\nThe holy places of the LORD’S house.\n¶“Therefore behold, the days are coming,” declares the LORD,\n“When I will punish her idols,\nAnd the mortally wounded will groan throughout her land.\n“Though Babylon ascends to the heavens,\nAnd though she fortifies her lofty stronghold,\nDestroyers will come from Me to her,” declares the LORD.\n¶The sound of an outcry from Babylon,\nAnd of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!\nFor the LORD is going to destroy Babylon,\nAnd He will make her loud noise vanish from her.\nAnd their waves will roar like many waters;\nThe clamor of their voices sounds forth.\nFor the destroyer is coming against her, against Babylon,\nAnd her warriors will be captured,\nTheir bows shattered;\nFor the LORD is a God of retribution,\nHe will fully repay.\n“I will make her leaders and her wise men drunk,\nHer governors, her officials, and her warriors,\nSo that they will sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake up,”\nDeclares the King, whose name is the LORD of armies.\nThis is what the LORD of armies says:\n“The broad wall of Babylon will be completely demolished,\nAnd her high gates will be set on fire;\nSo the peoples will labor for nothing,\nAnd the nations become exhausted only for fire.”\nThe command that Jeremiah the prophet gave Seraiah the son of Neriah, the grandson of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. (And Seraiah was quartermaster.) Jeremiah wrote on a single scroll all the disaster which would come against Babylon, that is, all these words which have been written concerning Babylon. Then Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “As soon as you come to Babylon, see that you read all these words aloud, and say, ‘You, LORD, have promised concerning this place to cut it off, so that there will be nothing living in it, whether man or animal; but it will be a permanent desolation.’ And as soon as you finish reading this scroll, you shall tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates, and say, ‘Just so shall Babylon sink down and not rise again, because of the disaster that I am going to bring upon her; and they will become exhausted.’ ” To this point are the words of Jeremiah.",

He did evil in the sight of the LORD, in accordance with everything that Jehoiakim had done. For because of the anger of the LORD this came about in Jerusalem and Judah, until He drove them out from His presence. And Zedekiah revolted against the king of Babylon. Now it came about in the ninth year of his reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, camped against it, and built a bulwark all around it. So the city was under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land. Then the city was breached, and all the warriors fled and left the city at night by way of the gate between the two walls which was by the king’s garden, though the Chaldeans were all around the city. And they went by way of the Arabah. But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the desert plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him. Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him. And the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and he also slaughtered all the commanders of Judah in Riblah. Then he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him with bronze shackles and brought him to Babylon and put him in prison until the day of his death.\nNow on the tenth day of the fifth month, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, who was in the service of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. And he burned the house of the LORD, the king’s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem; even every large house he burned with fire. So the entire army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard tore down all the walls around Jerusalem. Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took into exile some of the poorest of the people, the rest of the people who were left in the city, the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the craftsmen. But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and farmers.\nNow the bronze pillars which belonged to the house of the LORD and the stands and the bronze sea, which were in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans smashed to pieces and carried all their bronze to Babylon. They also took the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the pans, and all the bronze vessels which were used in temple service. The captain of the guard also took the bowls, the firepans, the basins, the pots, the lampstands, the pans, and the drink offering bowls, whatever was fine gold, and whatever was fine silver. The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the sea, and the stands, which King Solomon had made for the house of the LORD—the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weight. As for the pillars, the height of each pillar was eighteen cubits, and it was twelve cubits in circumference and four fingers in thickness, and hollow. Also, a capital of bronze was on top of it; and the height of each capital was five cubits, with latticework and pomegranates on the capital all around, all of bronze. And the second pillar was like these, including pomegranates. There were ninety-six exposed pomegranates; all the pomegranates numbered a hundred on the latticework all around.\nThen the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest and Zephaniah the second priest, with the three officers of the temple. He also took from the city one official who was overseer of the warriors, seven of the king’s advisers who were found in the city, the scribe of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men from the people of the land who were found inside the city. Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguards took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. Then the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was led into exile from its land.\nThese are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar took into exile: in the seventh year 3,023 Jews; in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar 832 persons from Jerusalem; in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took into exile 745 Jewish people; there were 4,600 people in all.\nNow it came about in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, showed favor to Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison. Then he spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the thrones of the kings who were with him in Babylon. So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes, and had his meals in the king’s presence regularly all the days of his life. And as his allowance, a regular allowance was given to him by the king of Babylon, a portion for each day, all the days of his life until the day of his death.",
