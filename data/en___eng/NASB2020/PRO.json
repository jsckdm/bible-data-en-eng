Who has sorrow?\nWho has contentions? Who has complaining?\nWho has wounds without cause?\nWho has red eyes?\nThose who linger long over wine,\nThose who go to taste mixed wine.\nDo not look at wine when it is red,\nWhen it sparkles in the cup,\nWhen it goes down smoothly;\nIn the end it bites like a snake\nAnd stings like a viper.\nYour eyes will see strange things\nAnd your mind will say perverse things.\nAnd you will be like one who lies down in the middle of the sea,\nOr like one who lies down on the top of a mast.\n“They struck me, but I did not become ill;\nThey beat me, but I did not know it.\nWhen will I awake?\nI will seek another drink.”",

Eat only what you need,\nSo that you do not have it in excess and vomit it.\nLet your foot rarely be in your neighbor’s house,\nOr he will become weary of you and hate you.\nLike a club, a sword, and a sharp arrow\nIs a person who gives false testimony against his neighbor.\nLike a bad tooth and an unsteady foot\nIs confidence in a treacherous person in time of trouble.\nLike one who takes off a garment on a cold day, or like vinegar on soda,\nIs one who sings songs to a troubled heart.\nIf your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat;\nAnd if he is thirsty, give him water to drink;\nFor you will heap burning coals on his head,\nAnd the LORD will reward you.\nThe north wind brings rain,\nAnd a gossiping tongue brings an angry face.\nIt is better to live on a corner of the roof,\nThan in a house shared with a contentious woman.\nLike cold water to a weary soul,\nSo is good news from a distant land.\nLike a trampled spring and a polluted well,\nSo is a righteous person who gives way before the wicked.\nIt is not good to eat much honey,\nNor is it glory to search out one’s own glory.\nLike a city that is broken into and without walls\nSo is a person who has no self-control over his spirit.",
