Oh no!’\nThey also call the farmer to mourning\nAnd professional mourners to mourning rites.\n“And in all the vineyards there is mourning,\nBecause I will pass through the midst of you,” says the LORD.\n¶Woe to you who are longing for the day of the LORD,\nFor what purpose will the day of the LORD be to you?\nIt will be darkness and not light;\nAs when a man flees from a lion\nAnd a bear confronts him,\nOr he goes home, leans with his hand against the wall,\nAnd a snake bites him.\nWill the day of the LORD not be darkness instead of light,\nEven gloom with no brightness in it?\n¶“I hate, I reject your festivals,\nNor do I delight in your festive assemblies.\n“Even though you offer up to Me burnt offerings and your grain offerings,\nI will not accept them;\nAnd I will not even look at the peace offerings of your fattened oxen.\n“Take away from Me the noise of your songs;\nI will not even listen to the sound of your harps.\n“But let justice roll out like waters,\nAnd righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.\n“Did you present Me with sacrifices and grain offerings in the wilderness for forty years, house of Israel? You also carried along Sikkuth your king and Kiyyun, your images, the star of your gods which you made for yourselves. Therefore I will make you go into exile beyond Damascus,” says the LORD, whose name is the God of armies.",

And behold, the spring crop was after the king’s mowing. And it came about, when it had finished eating the vegetation of the land, that I said,\n“Lord GOD, please pardon!\nHow can Jacob stand?\nFor he is small.”\nThe LORD relented of this.\n“It shall not be,” said the LORD.\nSo the Lord GOD showed me, and behold, the Lord GOD was calling to contend with them by fire, and it consumed the great deep and began to consume the farmland. Then I said,\n“Lord GOD, please stop!\nHow can Jacob stand?\nFor he is small.”\nThe LORD relented of this.\n“This too shall not be,” said the Lord GOD.\nSo He showed me, and behold, the Lord was standing by a vertical wall with a plumb line in His hand. And the LORD said to me, “What do you see, Amos?” And I said, “A plumb line.” Then the Lord said,\n“Behold I am about to put a plumb line\nIn the midst of My people Israel.\nI will not spare them any longer.\n“The high places of Isaac will become deserted,\nAnd the sanctuaries of Israel will be in ruins.\nThen I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.”\n\nThen Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent word to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, “Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is unable to endure all his words. For this is what Amos says: ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will certainly go from its land into exile.’ ” Then Amaziah said to Amos, “Go, you seer, flee to the land of Judah; and eat bread there and do your prophesying there! But do not prophesy at Bethel any longer, for it is a sanctuary of the king and a royal residence.”\nThen Amos replied to Amaziah, “I am not a prophet, nor am I the son of a prophet; for I am a herdsman and a grower of sycamore figs. But the LORD took me from following the flock, and the LORD said to me, ‘Go prophesy to My people Israel.’ So now hear the word of the LORD: you are saying, ‘You shall not prophesy against Israel nor shall you prophesy against the house of Isaac.’ Therefore, this is what the LORD says: ‘Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, your sons and your daughters will fall by the sword, your land will be parceled up by a measuring line, and you yourself will die upon unclean soil. Furthermore Israel will certainly go from its land into exile.’ ”",

And He said, “What do you see, Amos?” And I said, “A basket of summer fruit.” Then the LORD said to me, “The end has come for My people Israel. I will not spare them any longer. The songs of the palace will turn to wailing on that day,” declares the Lord GOD. “The corpses will be many; in every place they will throw them out. Hush!”\nHear this, you who trample the needy, to put an end to the humble of the land, saying,\n“When will the new moon be over,\nSo that we may sell grain;\nAnd the Sabbath, so that we may open the wheat market,\nTo make the ephah smaller and the shekel bigger,\nAnd to cheat with dishonest scales,\nSo as to buy the helpless for money,\nAnd the needy for a pair of sandals,\nAnd that we may sell the refuse of the wheat?”\n¶The LORD has sworn by the pride of Jacob,\n“Indeed, I will never forget any of their deeds.\n“Because of this will the land not quake,\nAnd everyone who lives in it mourn?\nIndeed, all of it will rise up like the Nile,\nAnd it will be tossed about\nAnd subside like the Nile of Egypt.\n“And it will come about on that day,” declares the Lord GOD,\n“That I will make the sun go down at noon,\nAnd make the earth dark in broad daylight.\n“Then I will turn your festivals into mourning,\nAnd all your songs into songs of mourning;\nAnd I will put sackcloth around everyone’s waist,\nAnd baldness on every head.\nAnd I will make it like a time of mourning for an only son,\nAnd the end of it will be like a bitter day.\n¶“Behold, days are coming,” declares the Lord GOD,\n“When I will send a famine on the land,\nNot a famine of bread or a thirst for water,\nBut rather for hearing the words of the LORD.\n“People will stagger from sea to sea\nAnd from the north even to the east;\nThey will roam about to seek the word of the LORD,\nBut they will not find it.\n“On that day the beautiful virgins\nAnd the young men will faint from thirst.\n“As for those who swear by the guilt of Samaria,\nAnd say, ‘As your god lives, Dan,’\nAnd, ‘As the way of Beersheba lives,’\nThey will fall and not rise again.”",
