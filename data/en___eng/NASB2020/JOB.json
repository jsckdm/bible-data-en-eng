      "chapter_text": "There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was blameless, upright, fearing God and turning away from evil. Seven sons and three daughters were born to him. His possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and very many servants; and that man was the greatest of all the men of the east. His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send word and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. When the days of feasting had completed their cycle, Job would send word to them and consecrate them, getting up early in the morning and offering burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, “Perhaps my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” Job did so continually.\nNow there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them. The LORD said to Satan, “From where do you come?” Satan answered the LORD and said, “From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.” The LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, fearing God and turning away from evil.” Then Satan answered the LORD, “Does Job fear God for nothing? Have You not made a fence around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. But reach out with Your hand now and touch all that he has; he will certainly curse You to Your face.” Then the LORD said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your power; only do not reach out and put your hand on him.” So Satan departed from the presence of the LORD.\n\nNow on the day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the female donkeys feeding beside them, and the Sabeans attacked and took them. They also killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.” While he was still speaking, another came and said, “The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.” While he was still speaking, another came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three units and made a raid on the camels and took them, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.” While he was still speaking, another also came and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, and behold, a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people and they died, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”\nThen Job got up, tore his robe, and shaved his head; then he fell to the ground and worshiped. He said,\n“Naked I came from my mother’s womb,\nAnd naked I shall return there.\nThe LORD gave and the LORD has taken away.\nBlessed be the name of the LORD.”\nDespite all this, Job did not sin, nor did he blame God.",

The LORD said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Then Satan answered the LORD and said, “From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.” The LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man fearing God and turning away from evil. And he still holds firm to his integrity, although you incited Me against him to ruin him without cause.” Satan answered the LORD and said, “Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has, he will give for his life. However, reach out with Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh; he will curse You to Your face!” So the LORD said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your power, only spare his life.”\nThen Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and struck Job with severe boils from the sole of his foot to the top of his head. And Job took a piece of pottery to scrape himself while he was sitting in the ashes.\nThen his wife said to him, “Do you still hold firm your integrity? Curse God and die!” But he said to her, “You are speaking as one of the foolish women speaks. Shall we actually accept good from God but not accept adversity?” Despite all this, Job did not sin with his lips.\nNow when Job’s three friends heard about all this adversity that had come upon him, they came, each one from his own place—Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to sympathize with him and comfort him. When they looked from a distance and did not recognize him, they raised their voices and wept. And each of them tore his robe, and they threw dust over their heads toward the sky. Then they sat down on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights, with no one speaking a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great.",

But when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, his anger burned.\nSo Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite spoke out and said,\n“I am young in years and you are old;\nTherefore I was shy and afraid to tell you what I think.\n“I thought age should speak,\nAnd increased years should teach wisdom.\n“But it is a spirit that is in mankind,\nAnd the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding.\n“The abundant in years may not be wise,\nNor may elders understand justice.\n“So I say, ‘Listen to me,\nI too will tell what I think.’\n¶“Behold, I waited for your words,\nI listened to your skillful speech,\nWhile you pondered what to say.\n“I also paid close attention to you;\nBut indeed, there was no one who refuted Job,\nNot one of you who answered his words.\n“So do not say,\n‘We have found wisdom:\nGod will defeat him, not man.’\n“But he has not presented his words against me,\nNor will I reply to him with your arguments.\n¶“They are dismayed, they no longer answer;\nWords have failed them.\n“Should I wait, because they are not speaking,\nBecause they have stopped and no longer answer?\n“I too will give my share of answers;\nI also will tell my opinion.\n“For I am full of words;\nThe spirit within me compels me.\n“Behold, my belly is like unvented wine;\nLike new wineskins, it is about to burst.\n“Let me speak so that I may get relief;\nLet me open my lips and answer.\n“Let me be partial to no one,\nNor flatter any man.\n“For I do not know how to flatter,\nOtherwise my Maker would quickly take me away.",

Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to My servant Job, and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves, and My servant Job will pray for you. For I will accept him so as not to do with you as your foolishness deserves, because you have not spoken of Me what is trustworthy, as My servant Job has.” So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the LORD told them; and the LORD accepted Job.\n\nThe LORD also restored the fortunes of Job when he prayed for his friends, and the LORD increased double all that Job had. Then all his brothers, all his sisters, and all who had known him before came to him, and they ate bread with him in his house; and they sympathized with him and comforted him for all the adversities that the LORD had brought on him. And each one gave him a piece of money, and each a ring of gold. The LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; and he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys. He also had seven sons and three daughters. He named the first Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch. In all the land no women were found as beautiful as Job’s daughters; and their father gave them inheritances among their brothers. After this, Job lived 140 years, and saw his sons and his grandsons, four generations. And Job died, an old man and full of days.",
