Unclean!” they cried out of themselves.\n“Keep away, keep away, do not touch!”\nFor they distanced themselves as well as wandered;\nPeople among the nations said,\n“They shall not continue to reside with us.”\nThe presence of the LORD has scattered them,\nHe will not continue to look at them;\nThey did not honor the priests,\nThey did not favor the elders.\nYet our eyes failed,\nLooking for help was useless;\nAt our observation point we have watched\nFor a nation that could not save.\nThey hunted our steps\nSo that we could not walk in our streets;\nOur end drew near,\nOur days were finished\nFor our end had come.\nOur pursuers were swifter\nThan the eagles of the sky;\nThey chased us on the mountains,\nThey waited in ambush for us in the wilderness.\nThe breath of our nostrils, the LORD’S anointed,\nWas captured in their pits,\nOf whom we had said, “In his shadow\nWe shall live among the nations.”\nRejoice and be joyful, daughter of Edom,\nWho lives in the land of Uz;\nBut the cup will pass to you as well,\nYou will become drunk and expose yourself.\nThe punishment of your wrongdoing has been completed, daughter of Zion;\nHe will no longer exile you.\nBut He will punish your wrongdoing, daughter of Edom;\nHe will expose your sins!",
