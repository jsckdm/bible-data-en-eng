And one called to another and said:\n\n“Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts;\nthe whole earth is full of his glory!”\n\nAnd the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. And I said: “Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!”\nThen one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar. And he touched my mouth and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.”\n\nAnd I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” Then I said, “Here I am! Send me.” And he said, “Go, and say to this people:\n\n“‘Keep on hearing, but do not understand;\nkeep on seeing, but do not perceive.’\nMake the heart of this people dull,\nand their ears heavy,\nand blind their eyes;\nlest they see with their eyes,\nand hear with their ears,\nand understand with their hearts,\nand turn and be healed.”\nThen I said, “How long, O Lord?”\nAnd he said:\n“Until cities lie waste\nwithout inhabitant,\nand houses without people,\nand the land is a desolate waste,\nand the LORD removes people far away,\nand the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.\nAnd though a tenth remain in it,\nit will be burned again,\nlike a terebinth or an oak,\nwhose stump remains\nwhen it is felled.”\nThe holy seed is its stump.",

When the house of David was told, “Syria is in league with Ephraim,” the heart of Ahaz and the heart of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake before the wind.\nAnd the LORD said to Isaiah, “Go out to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-jashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Washer’s Field. And say to him, ‘Be careful, be quiet, do not fear, and do not let your heart be faint because of these two smoldering stumps of firebrands, at the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria and the son of Remaliah. Because Syria, with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has devised evil against you, saying, “Let us go up against Judah and terrify it, and let us conquer it for ourselves, and set up the son of Tabeel as king in the midst of it,” thus says the Lord GOD:\n\n“‘It shall not stand,\nand it shall not come to pass.\nFor the head of Syria is Damascus,\nand the head of Damascus is Rezin.\nAnd within sixty-five years\nEphraim will be shattered from being a people.\nAnd the head of Ephraim is Samaria,\nand the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah.\nIf you are not firm in faith,\nyou will not be firm at all.’”\n\nAgain the LORD spoke to Ahaz: “Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven.” But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test.” And he said, “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also? Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. He shall eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good. For before the boy knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you dread will be deserted. The LORD will bring upon you and upon your people and upon your father’s house such days as have not come since the day that Ephraim departed from Judah—the king of Assyria!”\nIn that day the LORD will whistle for the fly that is at the end of the streams of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria. And they will all come and settle in the steep ravines, and in the clefts of the rocks, and on all the thornbushes, and on all the pastures.\nIn that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired beyond the River—with the king of Assyria—the head and the hair of the feet, and it will sweep away the beard also.\nIn that day a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep, and because of the abundance of milk that they give, he will eat curds, for everyone who is left in the land will eat curds and honey.\nIn that day every place where there used to be a thousand vines, worth a thousand shekels of silver, will become briers and thorns. With bow and arrows a man will come there, for all the land will be briers and thorns. And as for all the hills that used to be hoed with a hoe, you will not come there for fear of briers and thorns, but they will become a place where cattle are let loose and where sheep tread.",

Then the LORD said to me, “Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz; for before the boy knows how to cry ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria.”\nThe LORD spoke to me again: “Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah that flow gently, and rejoice over Rezin and the son of Remaliah, therefore, behold, the Lord is bringing up against them the waters of the River, mighty and many, the king of Assyria and all his glory. And it will rise over all its channels and go over all its banks, and it will sweep on into Judah, it will overflow and pass on, reaching even to the neck, and its outspread wings will fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.”\n\nBe broken, you peoples, and be shattered;\ngive ear, all you far countries;\nstrap on your armor and be shattered;\nstrap on your armor and be shattered.\nTake counsel together, but it will come to nothing;\nspeak a word, but it will not stand,\nfor God is with us.\nLORD\nFor the LORD spoke thus to me with his strong hand upon me, and warned me not to walk in the way of this people, saying: “Do not call conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy, and do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread. But the LORD of hosts, him you shall honor as holy. Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. And he will become a sanctuary and a stone of offense and a rock of stumbling to both houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And many shall stumble on it. They shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and taken.”\nBind up the testimony; seal the teaching among my disciples. I will wait for the LORD, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope in him. Behold, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are signs and portents in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion. And when they say to you, “Inquire of the mediums and the necromancers who chirp and mutter,” should not a people inquire of their God? Should they inquire of the dead on behalf of the living? To the teaching and to the testimony! If they will not speak according to this word, it is because they have no dawn. They will pass through the land, greatly distressed and hungry. And when they are hungry, they will be enraged and will speak contemptuously against their king and their God, and turn their faces upward. And they will look to the earth, but behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish. And they will be thrust into thick darkness.",

For he says:\n\n“By the strength of my hand I have done it,\nand by my wisdom, for I have understanding;\nI remove the boundaries of peoples,\nand plunder their treasures;\nlike a bull I bring down those who sit on thrones.\nMy hand has found like a nest\nthe wealth of the peoples;\nand as one gathers eggs that have been forsaken,\nso I have gathered all the earth;\nand there was none that moved a wing\nor opened the mouth or chirped.”\n\nShall the axe boast over him who hews with it,\nor the saw magnify itself against him who wields it?\nAs if a rod should wield him who lifts it,\nor as if a staff should lift him who is not wood!\nTherefore the Lord GOD of hosts\nwill send wasting sickness among his stout warriors,\nand under his glory a burning will be kindled,\nlike the burning of fire.\nThe light of Israel will become a fire,\nand his Holy One a flame,\nand it will burn and devour\nhis thorns and briers in one day.\nThe glory of his forest and of his fruitful land\nthe LORD will destroy, both soul and body,\nand it will be as when a sick man wastes away.\nThe remnant of the trees of his forest will be so few\nthat a child can write them down.\n\nIn that day the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no more lean on him who struck them, but will lean on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth. A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God. For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. Destruction is decreed, overflowing with righteousness. For the Lord GOD of hosts will make a full end, as decreed, in the midst of all the earth.\nTherefore thus says the Lord GOD of hosts: “O my people, who dwell in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrians when they strike with the rod and lift up their staff against you as the Egyptians did. For in a very little while my fury will come to an end, and my anger will be directed to their destruction. And the LORD of hosts will wield against them a whip, as when he struck Midian at the rock of Oreb. And his staff will be over the sea, and he will lift it as he did in Egypt. And in that day his burden will depart from your shoulder, and his yoke from your neck; and the yoke will be broken because of the fat.”\n\nHe has come to Aiath;\nhe has passed through Migron;\nat Michmash he stores his baggage;\nthey have crossed over the pass;\nat Geba they lodge for the night;\nRamah trembles;\nGibeah of Saul has fled.\nCry aloud, O daughter of Gallim!\nGive attention, O Laishah!\nO poor Anathoth!\nMadmenah is in flight;\nthe inhabitants of Gebim flee for safety.\nThis very day he will halt at Nob;\nhe will shake his fist\nat the mount of the daughter of Zion,\nthe hill of Jerusalem.\n\nBehold, the Lord GOD of hosts\nwill lop the boughs with terrifying power;\nthe great in height will be hewn down,\nand the lofty will be brought low.\nHe will cut down the thickets of the forest with an axe,\nand Lebanon will fall by the Majestic One.",

But now the LORD has spoken, saying, “In three years, like the years of a hired worker, the glory of Moab will be brought into contempt, in spite of all his great multitude, and those who remain will be very few and feeble.”",

And the land of Judah will become a terror to the Egyptians. Everyone to whom it is mentioned will fear because of the purpose that the LORD of hosts has purposed against them.\nIn that day there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the LORD of hosts. One of these will be called the City of Destruction.\nIn that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the LORD at its border. It will be a sign and a witness to the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt. When they cry to the LORD because of oppressors, he will send them a savior and defender, and deliver them. And the LORD will make himself known to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians will know the LORD in that day and worship with sacrifice and offering, and they will make vows to the LORD and perform them. And the LORD will strike Egypt, striking and healing, and they will return to the LORD, and he will listen to their pleas for mercy and heal them.\nIn that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and Assyria will come into Egypt, and Egypt into Assyria, and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.\nIn that day Israel will be the third with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth, whom the LORD of hosts has blessed, saying, “Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my inheritance.”",

You collected the waters of the lower pool, and you counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall. You made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you did not look to him who did it, or see him who planned it long ago.\n\nIn that day the Lord GOD of hosts\ncalled for weeping and mourning,\nfor baldness and wearing sackcloth;\nand behold, joy and gladness,\nkilling oxen and slaughtering sheep,\neating flesh and drinking wine.\n“Let us eat and drink,\nfor tomorrow we die.”\nThe LORD of hosts has revealed himself in my ears:\n“Surely this iniquity will not be atoned for you until you die,”\nsays the Lord GOD of hosts.\n\nThus says the Lord GOD of hosts, “Come, go to this steward, to Shebna, who is over the household, and say to him: What have you to do here, and whom have you here, that you have cut out here a tomb for yourself, you who cut out a tomb on the height and carve a dwelling for yourself in the rock? Behold, the LORD will hurl you away violently, O you strong man. He will seize firm hold on you and whirl you around and around, and throw you like a ball into a wide land. There you shall die, and there shall be your glorious chariots, you shame of your master’s house. I will thrust you from your office, and you will be pulled down from your station. In that day I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and I will clothe him with your robe, and will bind your sash on him, and will commit your authority to his hand. And he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. And I will place on his shoulder the key of the house of David. He shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open. And I will fasten him like a peg in a secure place, and he will become a throne of honor to his father’s house. And they will hang on him the whole honor of his father’s house, the offspring and issue, every small vessel, from the cups to all the flagons. In that day, declares the LORD of hosts, the peg that was fastened in a secure place will give way, and it will be cut down and fall, and the load that was on it will be cut off, for the LORD has spoken.”",

When men give it to one who can read, saying, “Read this,” he says, “I cannot, for it is sealed.” And when they give the book to one who cannot read, saying, “Read this,” he says, “I cannot read.”\n\nAnd the Lord said:\n“Because this people draw near with their mouth\nand honor me with their lips,\nwhile their hearts are far from me,\nand their fear of me is a commandment taught by men,\ntherefore, behold, I will again\ndo wonderful things with this people,\nwith wonder upon wonder;\nand the wisdom of their wise men shall perish,\nand the discernment of their discerning men shall be hidden.”\n\nAh, you who hide deep from the LORD your counsel,\nwhose deeds are in the dark,\nand who say, “Who sees us? Who knows us?”\nYou turn things upside down!\nShall the potter be regarded as the clay,\nthat the thing made should say of its maker,\n“He did not make me”;\nor the thing formed say of him who formed it,\n“He has no understanding”?\n\nIs it not yet a very little while\nuntil Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field,\nand the fruitful field shall be regarded as a forest?\nIn that day the deaf shall hear\nthe words of a book,\nand out of their gloom and darkness\nthe eyes of the blind shall see.\nThe meek shall obtain fresh joy in the LORD,\nand the poor among mankind shall exult in the Holy One of Israel.\nFor the ruthless shall come to nothing\nand the scoffer cease,\nand all who watch to do evil shall be cut off,\nwho by a word make a man out to be an offender,\nand lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate,\nand with an empty plea turn aside him who is in the right.\n\nTherefore thus says the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob:\n\n“Jacob shall no more be ashamed,\nno more shall his face grow pale.\nFor when he sees his children,\nthe work of my hands, in his midst,\nthey will sanctify my name;\nthey will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob\nand will stand in awe of the God of Israel.\nAnd those who go astray in spirit will come to understanding,\nand those who murmur will accept instruction.”",

We will flee upon horses”;\ntherefore you shall flee away;\nand, “We will ride upon swift steeds”;\ntherefore your pursuers shall be swift.\nA thousand shall flee at the threat of one;\nat the threat of five you shall flee,\ntill you are left\nlike a flagstaff on the top of a mountain,\nlike a signal on a hill.\nLORD\nTherefore the LORD waits to be gracious to you,\nand therefore he exalts himself to show mercy to you.\nFor the LORD is a God of justice;\nblessed are all those who wait for him.\n\nFor a people shall dwell in Zion, in Jerusalem; you shall weep no more. He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry. As soon as he hears it, he answers you. And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your Teacher will not hide himself anymore, but your eyes shall see your Teacher. And your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, “This is the way, walk in it,” when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left. Then you will defile your carved idols overlaid with silver and your gold-plated metal images. You will scatter them as unclean things. You will say to them, “Be gone!”\nAnd he will give rain for the seed with which you sow the ground, and bread, the produce of the ground, which will be rich and plenteous. In that day your livestock will graze in large pastures, and the oxen and the donkeys that work the ground will eat seasoned fodder, which has been winnowed with shovel and fork. And on every lofty mountain and every high hill there will be brooks running with water, in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall. Moreover, the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day when the LORD binds up the brokenness of his people, and heals the wounds inflicted by his blow.\n\nBehold, the name of the LORD comes from afar,\nburning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke;\nhis lips are full of fury,\nand his tongue is like a devouring fire;\nhis breath is like an overflowing stream\nthat reaches up to the neck;\nto sift the nations with the sieve of destruction,\nand to place on the jaws of the peoples a bridle that leads astray.\n\nYou shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept, and gladness of heart, as when one sets out to the sound of the flute to go to the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel. And the LORD will cause his majestic voice to be heard and the descending blow of his arm to be seen, in furious anger and a flame of devouring fire, with a cloudburst and storm and hailstones. The Assyrians will be terror-stricken at the voice of the LORD, when he strikes with his rod. And every stroke of the appointed staff that the LORD lays on them will be to the sound of tambourines and lyres. Battling with brandished arm, he will fight with them. For a burning place has long been prepared; indeed, for the king it is made ready, its pyre made deep and wide, with fire and wood in abundance; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of sulfur, kindles it.",

And the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem, with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Washer’s Field. And there came out to him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder.\nAnd the Rabshakeh said to them, “Say to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: On what do you rest this trust of yours? Do you think that mere words are strategy and power for war? In whom do you now trust, that you have rebelled against me? Behold, you are trusting in Egypt, that broken reed of a staff, which will pierce the hand of any man who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him. But if you say to me, “We trust in the LORD our God,” is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed, saying to Judah and to Jerusalem, “You shall worship before this altar”? Come now, make a wager with my master the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them. How then can you repulse a single captain among the least of my master’s servants, when you trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? Moreover, is it without the LORD that I have come up against this land to destroy it? The LORD said to me, “Go up against this land and destroy it.”’”\nThen Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Do not speak to us in the language of Judah within the hearing of the people who are on the wall.” But the Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you, and not to the men sitting on the wall, who are doomed with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?”\nThen the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language of Judah: “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria! Thus says the king: ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you. Do not let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD by saying, “The LORD will surely deliver us. This city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.” Do not listen to Hezekiah. For thus says the king of Assyria: Make your peace with me and come out to me. Then each one of you will eat of his own vine, and each one of his own fig tree, and each one of you will drink the water of his own cistern, until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. Beware lest Hezekiah mislead you by saying, “The LORD will deliver us.” Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their lands out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?’”\nBut they were silent and answered him not a word, for the king’s command was, “Do not answer him.” Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of the Rabshakeh.",

And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and the senior priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz. They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, ‘This day is a day of distress, of rebuke, and of disgrace; children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to bring them forth. It may be that the LORD your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke the words that the LORD your God has heard; therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.’”\nWhen the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah, Isaiah said to them, “Say to your master, ‘Thus says the LORD: Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the young men of the king of Assyria have reviled me. Behold, I will put a spirit in him, so that he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land, and I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.’”\nThe Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that the king had left Lachish. Now the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, “He has set out to fight against you.” And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah: ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, devoting them to destruction. And shall you be delivered? Have the gods of the nations delivered them, the nations that my fathers destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar? Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?’”\n\nHezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD. And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD: “O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, enthroned above the cherubim, you are the God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth. Incline your ear, O LORD, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God. Truly, O LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their lands, and have cast their gods into the fire. For they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone. Therefore they were destroyed. So now, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are the LORD.”\n\nThen Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria, this is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning him:\n\n“‘She despises you, she scorns you—\nthe virgin daughter of Zion;\nshe wags her head behind you—\nthe daughter of Jerusalem.\n\n“‘Whom have you mocked and reviled?\nAgainst whom have you raised your voice\nand lifted your eyes to the heights?\nAgainst the Holy One of Israel!\nBy your servants you have mocked the Lord,\nand you have said, With my many chariots\nI have gone up the heights of the mountains,\nto the far recesses of Lebanon,\nto cut down its tallest cedars,\nits choicest cypresses,\nto come to its remotest height,\nits most fruitful forest.\nI dug wells\nand drank waters,\nto dry up with the sole of my foot\nall the streams of Egypt.\n\n“‘Have you not heard\nthat I determined it long ago?\nI planned from days of old\nwhat now I bring to pass,\nthat you should make fortified cities\ncrash into heaps of ruins,\nwhile their inhabitants, shorn of strength,\nare dismayed and confounded,\nand have become like plants of the field\nand like tender grass,\nlike grass on the housetops,\nblighted before it is grown.\n\n“‘I know your sitting down\nand your going out and coming in,\nand your raging against me.\nBecause you have raged against me\nand your complacency has come to my ears,\nI will put my hook in your nose\nand my bit in your mouth,\nand I will turn you back on the way\nby which you came.’\n\n“And this shall be the sign for you: this year you shall eat what grows of itself, and in the second year what springs from that. Then in the third year sow and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward. For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.\n“Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city or shoot an arrow there or come before it with a shield or cast up a siege mound against it. By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and he shall not come into this city, declares the LORD. For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David.”\nAnd the angel of the LORD went out and struck down 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians. And when people arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies. Then Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned home and lived at Nineveh. And as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, struck him down with the sword. And after they escaped into the land of Ararat, Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place.",

And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, “Thus says the LORD: Set your house in order, for you shall die, you shall not recover.” Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD, and said, “Please, O LORD, remember how I have walked before you in faithfulness and with a whole heart, and have done what is good in your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.\nThen the word of the LORD came to Isaiah: “Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father: I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life. I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and will defend this city.\n“This shall be the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he has promised: Behold, I will make the shadow cast by the declining sun on the dial of Ahaz turn back ten steps.” So the sun turned back on the dial the ten steps by which it had declined.\n\nA writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, after he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:\n\nI said, In the middle of my days\nI must depart;\nI am consigned to the gates of Sheol\nfor the rest of my years.\nI said, I shall not see the LORD,\nthe LORD in the land of the living;\nI shall look on man no more\namong the inhabitants of the world.\nMy dwelling is plucked up and removed from me\nlike a shepherd’s tent;\nlike a weaver I have rolled up my life;\nhe cuts me off from the loom;\nfrom day to night you bring me to an end;\nI calmed myself until morning;\nlike a lion he breaks all my bones;\nfrom day to night you bring me to an end.\n\nLike a swallow or a crane I chirp;\nI moan like a dove.\nMy eyes are weary with looking upward.\nO Lord, I am oppressed; be my pledge of safety!\nWhat shall I say? For he has spoken to me,\nand he himself has done it.\nI walk slowly all my years\nbecause of the bitterness of my soul.\n\nO Lord, by these things men live,\nand in all these is the life of my spirit.\nOh restore me to health and make me live!\nBehold, it was for my welfare\nthat I had great bitterness;\nbut in love you have delivered my life\nfrom the pit of destruction,\nfor you have cast all my sins\nbehind your back.\nFor Sheol does not thank you;\ndeath does not praise you;\nthose who go down to the pit do not hope\nfor your faithfulness.\nThe living, the living, he thanks you,\nas I do this day;\nthe father makes known to the children\nyour faithfulness.\n\nThe LORD will save me,\nand we will play my music on stringed instruments\nall the days of our lives,\nat the house of the LORD.\n\nNow Isaiah had said, “Let them take a cake of figs and apply it to the boil, that he may recover.” Hezekiah also had said, “What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?”",

A craftsman casts it,\nand a goldsmith overlays it with gold\nand casts for it silver chains.\nHe who is too impoverished for an offering\nchooses wood that will not rot;\nhe seeks out a skillful craftsman\nto set up an idol that will not move.\n\nDo you not know? Do you not hear?\nHas it not been told you from the beginning?\nHave you not understood from the foundations of the earth?\nIt is he who sits above the circle of the earth,\nand its inhabitants are like grasshoppers;\nwho stretches out the heavens like a curtain,\nand spreads them like a tent to dwell in;\nwho brings princes to nothing,\nand makes the rulers of the earth as emptiness.\n\nScarcely are they planted, scarcely sown,\nscarcely has their stem taken root in the earth,\nwhen he blows on them, and they wither,\nand the tempest carries them off like stubble.\n\nTo whom then will you compare me,\nthat I should be like him? says the Holy One.\nLift up your eyes on high and see:\nwho created these?\nHe who brings out their host by number,\ncalling them all by name;\nby the greatness of his might\nand because he is strong in power,\nnot one is missing.\n\nWhy do you say, O Jacob,\nand speak, O Israel,\n“My way is hidden from the LORD,\nand my right is disregarded by my God”?\nHave you not known? Have you not heard?\nThe LORD is the everlasting God,\nthe Creator of the ends of the earth.\nHe does not faint or grow weary;\nhis understanding is unsearchable.\nHe gives power to the faint,\nand to him who has no might he increases strength.\nEven youths shall faint and be weary,\nand young men shall fall exhausted;\nbut they who wait for the LORD shall renew their strength;\nthey shall mount up with wings like eagles;\nthey shall run and not be weary;\nthey shall walk and not faint.",

      "chapter_text": "LORD\n“But now hear, O Jacob my servant,\nIsrael whom I have chosen!\nThus says the LORD who made you,\nwho formed you from the womb and will help you:\nFear not, O Jacob my servant,\nJeshurun whom I have chosen.\nFor I will pour water on the thirsty land,\nand streams on the dry ground;\nI will pour my Spirit upon your offspring,\nand my blessing on your descendants.\nThey shall spring up among the grass\nlike willows by flowing streams.\nThis one will say, ‘I am the LORD’s,’\nanother will call on the name of Jacob,\nand another will write on his hand, ‘The LORD’s,’\nand name himself by the name of Israel.”\n\nThus says the LORD, the King of Israel\nand his Redeemer, the LORD of hosts:\n“I am the first and I am the last;\nbesides me there is no god.\nWho is like me? Let him proclaim it.\nLet him declare and set it before me,\nsince I appointed an ancient people.\nLet them declare what is to come, and what will happen.\nFear not, nor be afraid;\nhave I not told you from of old and declared it?\nAnd you are my witnesses!\nIs there a God besides me?\nThere is no Rock; I know not any.”\n\nAll who fashion idols are nothing, and the things they delight in do not profit. Their witnesses neither see nor know, that they may be put to shame. Who fashions a god or casts an idol that is profitable for nothing? Behold, all his companions shall be put to shame, and the craftsmen are only human. Let them all assemble, let them stand forth. They shall be terrified; they shall be put to shame together.\nThe ironsmith takes a cutting tool and works it over the coals. He fashions it with hammers and works it with his strong arm. He becomes hungry, and his strength fails; he drinks no water and is faint. The carpenter stretches a line; he marks it out with a pencil. He shapes it with planes and marks it with a compass. He shapes it into the figure of a man, with the beauty of a man, to dwell in a house. He cuts down cedars, or he chooses a cypress tree or an oak and lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest. He plants a cedar and the rain nourishes it. Then it becomes fuel for a man. He takes a part of it and warms himself; he kindles a fire and bakes bread. Also he makes a god and worships it; he makes it an idol and falls down before it. Half of it he burns in the fire. Over the half he eats meat; he roasts it and is satisfied. Also he warms himself and says, “Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire!” And the rest of it he makes into a god, his idol, and falls down to it and worships it. He prays to it and says, “Deliver me, for you are my god!”\nThey know not, nor do they discern, for he has shut their eyes, so that they cannot see, and their hearts, so that they cannot understand. No one considers, nor is there knowledge or discernment to say, “Half of it I burned in the fire; I also baked bread on its coals; I roasted meat and have eaten. And shall I make the rest of it an abomination? Shall I fall down before a block of wood?” He feeds on ashes; a deluded heart has led him astray, and he cannot deliver himself or say, “Is there not a lie in my right hand?”\nLORD\nRemember these things, O Jacob,\nand Israel, for you are my servant;\nI formed you; you are my servant;\nO Israel, you will not be forgotten by me.\nI have blotted out your transgressions like a cloud\nand your sins like mist;\nreturn to me, for I have redeemed you.\n\nSing, O heavens, for the LORD has done it;\nshout, O depths of the earth;\nbreak forth into singing, O mountains,\nO forest, and every tree in it!\nFor the LORD has redeemed Jacob,\nand will be glorified in Israel.\n\nThus says the LORD, your Redeemer,\nwho formed you from the womb:\n“I am the LORD, who made all things,\nwho alone stretched out the heavens,\nwho spread out the earth by myself,\nwho frustrates the signs of liars\nand makes fools of diviners,\nwho turns wise men back\nand makes their knowledge foolish,\nwho confirms the word of his servant\nand fulfills the counsel of his messengers,\nwho says of Jerusalem, ‘She shall be inhabited,’\nand of the cities of Judah, ‘They shall be built,\nand I will raise up their ruins’;\nwho says to the deep, ‘Be dry;\nI will dry up your rivers’;\nwho says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd,\nand he shall fulfill all my purpose’;\nsaying of Jerusalem, ‘She shall be built,’\nand of the temple, ‘Your foundation shall be laid.’”",

Now therefore what have I here,” declares the LORD, “seeing that my people are taken away for nothing? Their rulers wail,” declares the LORD, “and continually all the day my name is despised. Therefore my people shall know my name. Therefore in that day they shall know that it is I who speak; here I am.”\n\nHow beautiful upon the mountains\nare the feet of him who brings good news,\nwho publishes peace, who brings good news of happiness,\nwho publishes salvation,\nwho says to Zion, “Your God reigns.”\nThe voice of your watchmen—they lift up their voice;\ntogether they sing for joy;\nfor eye to eye they see\nthe return of the LORD to Zion.\nBreak forth together into singing,\nyou waste places of Jerusalem,\nfor the LORD has comforted his people;\nhe has redeemed Jerusalem.\nThe LORD has bared his holy arm\nbefore the eyes of all the nations,\nand all the ends of the earth shall see\nthe salvation of our God.\n\nDepart, depart, go out from there;\ntouch no unclean thing;\ngo out from the midst of her; purify yourselves,\nyou who bear the vessels of the LORD.\nFor you shall not go out in haste,\nand you shall not go in flight,\nfor the LORD will go before you,\nand the God of Israel will be your rear guard.\n\nBehold, my servant shall act wisely;\nhe shall be high and lifted up,\nand shall be exalted.\nAs many were astonished at you—\nhis appearance was so marred, beyond human semblance,\nand his form beyond that of the children of mankind—\nso shall he sprinkle many nations.\nKings shall shut their mouths because of him,\nfor that which has not been told them they see,\nand that which they have not heard they understand.",

And they shall come and shall see my glory, and I will set a sign among them. And from them I will send survivors to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the coastlands far away, that have not heard my fame or seen my glory. And they shall declare my glory among the nations. And they shall bring all your brothers from all the nations as an offering to the LORD, on horses and in chariots and in litters and on mules and on dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the LORD, just as the Israelites bring their grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of the LORD. And some of them also I will take for priests and for Levites, says the LORD.\n\n“For as the new heavens and the new earth\nthat I make\nshall remain before me, says the LORD,\nso shall your offspring and your name remain.\nFrom new moon to new moon,\nand from Sabbath to Sabbath,\nall flesh shall come to worship before me,\ndeclares the LORD.\n\n“And they shall go out and look on the dead bodies of the men who have rebelled against me. For their worm shall not die, their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.”",
