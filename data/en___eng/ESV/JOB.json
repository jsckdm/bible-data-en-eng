      "chapter_text": "There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job, and that man was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil. There were born to him seven sons and three daughters. He possessed 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, and 500 female donkeys, and very many servants, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the east. His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. And when the days of the feast had run their course, Job would send and consecrate them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my children have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts.” Thus Job did continually.\n\nNow there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them. The LORD said to Satan, “From where have you come?” Satan answered the LORD and said, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it.” And the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil?” Then Satan answered the LORD and said, “Does Job fear God for no reason? Have you not put a hedge around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. But stretch out your hand and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face.” And the LORD said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your hand. Only against him do not stretch out your hand.” So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.\n\nNow there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, and there came a messenger to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them, and the Sabeans fell upon them and took them and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.” While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, “The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.” While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, “The Chaldeans formed three groups and made a raid on the camels and took them and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.” While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, and behold, a great wind came across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”\nThen Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head and fell on the ground and worshiped. And he said, “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.”\nIn all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrong.",

He still holds fast his integrity, although you incited me against him to destroy him without reason.” Then Satan answered the LORD and said, “Skin for skin! All that a man has he will give for his life. But stretch out your hand and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face.” And the LORD said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand; only spare his life.”\nSo Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and struck Job with loathsome sores from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. And he took a piece of broken pottery with which to scrape himself while he sat in the ashes.\nThen his wife said to him, “Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die.” But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. Shall we receive good from God, and shall we not receive evil?” In all this Job did not sin with his lips.\n\nNow when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, they came each from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They made an appointment together to come to show him sympathy and comfort him. And when they saw him from a distance, they did not recognize him. And they raised their voices and wept, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads toward heaven. And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his suffering was very great.",

Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were older than he. And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, he burned with anger.\nAnd Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said:\n\n“I am young in years,\nand you are aged;\ntherefore I was timid and afraid\nto declare my opinion to you.\nI said, ‘Let days speak,\nand many years teach wisdom.’\nBut it is the spirit in man,\nthe breath of the Almighty, that makes him understand.\nIt is not the old who are wise,\nnor the aged who understand what is right.\nTherefore I say, ‘Listen to me;\nlet me also declare my opinion.’\n\n“Behold, I waited for your words,\nI listened for your wise sayings,\nwhile you searched out what to say.\nI gave you my attention,\nand, behold, there was none among you who refuted Job\nor who answered his words.\nBeware lest you say, ‘We have found wisdom;\nGod may vanquish him, not a man.’\nHe has not directed his words against me,\nand I will not answer him with your speeches.\n\n“They are dismayed; they answer no more;\nthey have not a word to say.\nAnd shall I wait, because they do not speak,\nbecause they stand there, and answer no more?\nI also will answer with my share;\nI also will declare my opinion.\nFor I am full of words;\nthe spirit within me constrains me.\nBehold, my belly is like wine that has no vent;\nlike new wineskins ready to burst.\nI must speak, that I may find relief;\nI must open my lips and answer.\nI will not show partiality to any man\nor use flattery toward any person.\nFor I do not know how to flatter,\nelse my Maker would soon take me away.",

I will answer you,\nfor God is greater than man.\nWhy do you contend against him,\nsaying, ‘He will answer none of man’s words’?\nFor God speaks in one way,\nand in two, though man does not perceive it.\nIn a dream, in a vision of the night,\nwhen deep sleep falls on men,\nwhile they slumber on their beds,\nthen he opens the ears of men\nand terrifies them with warnings,\nthat he may turn man aside from his deed\nand conceal pride from a man;\nhe keeps back his soul from the pit,\nhis life from perishing by the sword.\n\n“Man is also rebuked with pain on his bed\nand with continual strife in his bones,\nso that his life loathes bread,\nand his appetite the choicest food.\nHis flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen,\nand his bones that were not seen stick out.\nHis soul draws near the pit,\nand his life to those who bring death.\nIf there be for him an angel,\na mediator, one of the thousand,\nto declare to man what is right for him,\nand he is merciful to him, and says,\n‘Deliver him from going down into the pit;\nI have found a ransom;\nlet his flesh become fresh with youth;\nlet him return to the days of his youthful vigor’;\nthen man prays to God, and he accepts him;\nhe sees his face with a shout of joy,\nand he restores to man his righteousness.\nHe sings before men and says:\n‘I sinned and perverted what was right,\nand it was not repaid to me.\nHe has redeemed my soul from going down into the pit,\nand my life shall look upon the light.’\n\n“Behold, God does all these things,\ntwice, three times, with a man,\nto bring back his soul from the pit,\nthat he may be lighted with the light of life.\nPay attention, O Job, listen to me;\nbe silent, and I will speak.\nIf you have any words, answer me;\nspeak, for I desire to justify you.\nIf not, listen to me;\nbe silent, and I will teach you wisdom.”",

Now therefore take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves. And my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.” So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what the LORD had told them, and the LORD accepted Job’s prayer.\nLORD\nAnd the LORD restored the fortunes of Job, when he had prayed for his friends. And the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before. Then came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and ate bread with him in his house. And they showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him. And each of them gave him a piece of money and a ring of gold.\nAnd the LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning. And he had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys. He had also seven sons and three daughters. And he called the name of the first daughter Jemimah, and the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-happuch. And in all the land there were no women so beautiful as Job’s daughters. And their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers. And after this Job lived 140 years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, four generations. And Job died, an old man, and full of days.",
