It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, and until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the captivity of Jerusalem in the fifth month.\n\nNow the word of the LORD came to me, saying,\n\n“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,\nand before you were born I consecrated you;\nI appointed you a prophet to the nations.”\n\nThen I said, “Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, I do not know how to speak, for I am only a youth.” But the LORD said to me,\n\n“Do not say, ‘I am only a youth’;\nfor to all to whom I send you, you shall go,\nand whatever I command you, you shall speak.\nDo not be afraid of them,\nfor I am with you to deliver you,\ndeclares the LORD.”\n\nThen the LORD put out his hand and touched my mouth. And the LORD said to me,\n\n“Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.\nSee, I have set you this day over nations and over kingdoms,\nto pluck up and to break down,\nto destroy and to overthrow,\nto build and to plant.”\n\nAnd the word of the LORD came to me, saying, “Jeremiah, what do you see?” And I said, “I see an almond branch.” Then the LORD said to me, “You have seen well, for I am watching over my word to perform it.”\nThe word of the LORD came to me a second time, saying, “What do you see?” And I said, “I see a boiling pot, facing away from the north.” Then the LORD said to me, “Out of the north disaster shall be let loose upon all the inhabitants of the land. For behold, I am calling all the tribes of the kingdoms of the north, declares the LORD, and they shall come, and every one shall set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, against all its walls all around and against all the cities of Judah. And I will declare my judgments against them, for all their evil in forsaking me. They have made offerings to other gods and worshiped the works of their own hands. But you, dress yourself for work; arise, and say to them everything that I command you. Do not be dismayed by them, lest I dismay you before them. And I, behold, I make you this day a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the people of the land. They will fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you, for I am with you, declares the LORD, to deliver you.”",

Thus says the LORD:\n\n“What wrong did your fathers find in me\nthat they went far from me,\nand went after worthlessness, and became worthless?\nThey did not say, ‘Where is the LORD\nwho brought us up from the land of Egypt,\nwho led us in the wilderness,\nin a land of deserts and pits,\nin a land of drought and deep darkness,\nin a land that none passes through,\nwhere no man dwells?’\nAnd I brought you into a plentiful land\nto enjoy its fruits and its good things.\nBut when you came in, you defiled my land\nand made my heritage an abomination.\nThe priests did not say, ‘Where is the LORD?’\nThose who handle the law did not know me;\nthe shepherds transgressed against me;\nthe prophets prophesied by Baal\nand went after things that do not profit.\n\n“Therefore I still contend with you,\ndeclares the LORD,\nand with your children’s children I will contend.\nFor cross to the coasts of Cyprus and see,\nor send to Kedar and examine with care;\nsee if there has been such a thing.\nHas a nation changed its gods,\neven though they are no gods?\nBut my people have changed their glory\nfor that which does not profit.\nBe appalled, O heavens, at this;\nbe shocked, be utterly desolate,\ndeclares the LORD,\nfor my people have committed two evils:\nthey have forsaken me,\nthe fountain of living waters,\nand hewed out cisterns for themselves,\nbroken cisterns that can hold no water.\n\n“Is Israel a slave? Is he a homeborn servant?\nWhy then has he become a prey?\nThe lions have roared against him;\nthey have roared loudly.\nThey have made his land a waste;\nhis cities are in ruins, without inhabitant.\nMoreover, the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes\nhave shaved the crown of your head.\nHave you not brought this upon yourself\nby forsaking the LORD your God,\nwhen he led you in the way?\nAnd now what do you gain by going to Egypt\nto drink the waters of the Nile?\nOr what do you gain by going to Assyria\nto drink the waters of the Euphrates?\nYour evil will chastise you,\nand your apostasy will reprove you.\nKnow and see that it is evil and bitter\nfor you to forsake the LORD your God;\nthe fear of me is not in you,\ndeclares the Lord GOD of hosts.\n\n“For long ago I broke your yoke\nand burst your bonds;\nbut you said, ‘I will not serve.’\nYes, on every high hill\nand under every green tree\nyou bowed down like a whore.\nYet I planted you a choice vine,\nwholly of pure seed.\nHow then have you turned degenerate\nand become a wild vine?\nThough you wash yourself with lye\nand use much soap,\nthe stain of your guilt is still before me,\ndeclares the Lord GOD.\nHow can you say, ‘I am not unclean,\nI have not gone after the Baals’?\nLook at your way in the valley;\nknow what you have done—\na restless young camel running here and there,\na wild donkey used to the wilderness,\nin her heat sniffing the wind!\nWho can restrain her lust?\nNone who seek her need weary themselves;\nin her month they will find her.\nKeep your feet from going unshod\nand your throat from thirst.\nBut you said, ‘It is hopeless,\nfor I have loved foreigners,\nand after them I will go.’\n\n“As a thief is shamed when caught,\nso the house of Israel shall be shamed:\nthey, their kings, their officials,\ntheir priests, and their prophets,\nwho say to a tree, ‘You are my father,’\nand to a stone, ‘You gave me birth.’\nFor they have turned their back to me,\nand not their face.\nBut in the time of their trouble they say,\n‘Arise and save us!’\nBut where are your gods\nthat you made for yourself?\nLet them arise, if they can save you,\nin your time of trouble;\nfor as many as your cities\nare your gods, O Judah.\n\n“Why do you contend with me?\nYou have all transgressed against me,\ndeclares the LORD.\nIn vain have I struck your children;\nthey took no correction;\nyour own sword devoured your prophets\nlike a ravening lion.\nAnd you, O generation, behold the word of the LORD.\nHave I been a wilderness to Israel,\nor a land of thick darkness?\nWhy then do my people say, ‘We are free,\nwe will come no more to you’?\nCan a virgin forget her ornaments,\nor a bride her attire?\nYet my people have forgotten me\ndays without number.\n\n“How well you direct your course\nto seek love!\nSo that even to wicked women\nyou have taught your ways.\nAlso on your skirts is found\nthe lifeblood of the guiltless poor;\nyou did not find them breaking in.\nYet in spite of all these things\nyou say, ‘I am innocent;\nsurely his anger has turned from me.’\nBehold, I will bring you to judgment\nfor saying, ‘I have not sinned.’\nHow much you go about,\nchanging your way!\nYou shall be put to shame by Egypt\nas you were put to shame by Assyria.\nFrom it too you will come away\nwith your hands on your head,\nfor the LORD has rejected those in whom you trust,\nand you will not prosper by them.",

And I thought, ‘After she has done all this she will return to me,’ but she did not return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw it. She saw that for all the adulteries of that faithless one, Israel, I had sent her away with a decree of divorce. Yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear, but she too went and played the whore. Because she took her whoredom lightly, she polluted the land, committing adultery with stone and tree. Yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah did not return to me with her whole heart, but in pretense, declares the LORD.”\nAnd the LORD said to me, “Faithless Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah. Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say,\n\n“‘Return, faithless Israel,\ndeclares the LORD.\nI will not look on you in anger,\nfor I am merciful,\ndeclares the LORD;\nI will not be angry forever.\nOnly acknowledge your guilt,\nthat you rebelled against the LORD your God\nand scattered your favors among foreigners under every green tree,\nand that you have not obeyed my voice,\ndeclares the LORD.\nReturn, O faithless children,\ndeclares the LORD;\nfor I am your master;\nI will take you, one from a city and two from a family,\nand I will bring you to Zion.\n\n“‘And I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding. And when you have multiplied and been fruitful in the land, in those days, declares the LORD, they shall no more say, “The ark of the covenant of the LORD.” It shall not come to mind or be remembered or missed; it shall not be made again. At that time Jerusalem shall be called the throne of the LORD, and all nations shall gather to it, to the presence of the LORD in Jerusalem, and they shall no more stubbornly follow their own evil heart. In those days the house of Judah shall join the house of Israel, and together they shall come from the land of the north to the land that I gave your fathers for a heritage.\n\n“‘I said,\nHow I would set you among my sons,\nand give you a pleasant land,\na heritage most beautiful of all nations.\nAnd I thought you would call me, My Father,\nand would not turn from following me.\nSurely, as a treacherous wife leaves her husband,\nso have you been treacherous to me, O house of Israel,\ndeclares the LORD.’”\n\nA voice on the bare heights is heard,\nthe weeping and pleading of Israel’s sons\nbecause they have perverted their way;\nthey have forgotten the LORD their God.\n“Return, O faithless sons;\nI will heal your faithlessness.”\n“Behold, we come to you,\nfor you are the LORD our God.\nTruly the hills are a delusion,\nthe orgies on the mountains.\nTruly in the LORD our God\nis the salvation of Israel.\n\n“But from our youth the shameful thing has devoured all for which our fathers labored, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. Let us lie down in our shame, and let our dishonor cover us. For we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and we have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.”",

The priests shall be appalled and the prophets astounded.” Then I said, “Ah, Lord GOD, surely you have utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, ‘It shall be well with you,’ whereas the sword has reached their very life.”\nAt that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A hot wind from the bare heights in the desert toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow or cleanse, a wind too full for this comes for me. Now it is I who speak in judgment upon them.”\n\nBehold, he comes up like clouds;\nhis chariots like the whirlwind;\nhis horses are swifter than eagles—\nwoe to us, for we are ruined!\nO Jerusalem, wash your heart from evil,\nthat you may be saved.\nHow long shall your wicked thoughts\nlodge within you?\nFor a voice declares from Dan\nand proclaims trouble from Mount Ephraim.\nWarn the nations that he is coming;\nannounce to Jerusalem,\n“Besiegers come from a distant land;\nthey shout against the cities of Judah.\nLike keepers of a field are they against her all around,\nbecause she has rebelled against me,\ndeclares the LORD.\nYour ways and your deeds\nhave brought this upon you.\nThis is your doom, and it is bitter;\nit has reached your very heart.”\n\nMy anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain!\nOh the walls of my heart!\nMy heart is beating wildly;\nI cannot keep silent,\nfor I hear the sound of the trumpet,\nthe alarm of war.\nCrash follows hard on crash;\nthe whole land is laid waste.\nSuddenly my tents are laid waste,\nmy curtains in a moment.\nHow long must I see the standard\nand hear the sound of the trumpet?\n\n“For my people are foolish;\nthey know me not;\nthey are stupid children;\nthey have no understanding.\nThey are ‘wise’—in doing evil!\nBut how to do good they know not.”\n\nI looked on the earth, and behold, it was without form and void;\nand to the heavens, and they had no light.\nI looked on the mountains, and behold, they were quaking,\nand all the hills moved to and fro.\nI looked, and behold, there was no man,\nand all the birds of the air had fled.\nI looked, and behold, the fruitful land was a desert,\nand all its cities were laid in ruins\nbefore the LORD, before his fierce anger.\n\nFor thus says the LORD, “The whole land shall be a desolation; yet I will not make a full end.\n\n“For this the earth shall mourn,\nand the heavens above be dark;\nfor I have spoken; I have purposed;\nI have not relented, nor will I turn back.”\n\nAt the noise of horseman and archer\nevery city takes to flight;\nthey enter thickets; they climb among rocks;\nall the cities are forsaken,\nand no man dwells in them.\nAnd you, O desolate one,\nwhat do you mean that you dress in scarlet,\nthat you adorn yourself with ornaments of gold,\nthat you enlarge your eyes with paint?\nIn vain you beautify yourself.\nYour lovers despise you;\nthey seek your life.\nFor I heard a cry as of a woman in labor,\nanguish as of one giving birth to her first child,\nthe cry of the daughter of Zion gasping for breath,\nstretching out her hands,\n“Woe is me! I am fainting before murderers.”",

Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Amend your ways and your deeds, and I will let you dwell in this place. Do not trust in these deceptive words: ‘This is the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD.’\n“For if you truly amend your ways and your deeds, if you truly execute justice one with another, if you do not oppress the sojourner, the fatherless, or the widow, or shed innocent blood in this place, and if you do not go after other gods to your own harm, then I will let you dwell in this place, in the land that I gave of old to your fathers forever.\n“Behold, you trust in deceptive words to no avail. Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, make offerings to Baal, and go after other gods that you have not known, and then come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, ‘We are delivered!’—only to go on doing all these abominations? Has this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I myself have seen it, declares the LORD. Go now to my place that was in Shiloh, where I made my name dwell at first, and see what I did to it because of the evil of my people Israel. And now, because you have done all these things, declares the LORD, and when I spoke to you persistently you did not listen, and when I called you, you did not answer, therefore I will do to the house that is called by my name, and in which you trust, and to the place that I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh. And I will cast you out of my sight, as I cast out all your kinsmen, all the offspring of Ephraim.\n“As for you, do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer for them, and do not intercede with me, for I will not hear you. Do you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? The children gather wood, the fathers kindle fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes for the queen of heaven. And they pour out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger. Is it I whom they provoke? declares the LORD. Is it not themselves, to their own shame? Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, my anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place, upon man and beast, upon the trees of the field and the fruit of the ground; it will burn and not be quenched.”\nThus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: “Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat the flesh. For in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak to your fathers or command them concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices. But this command I gave them: ‘Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people. And walk in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.’ But they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked in their own counsels and the stubbornness of their evil hearts, and went backward and not forward. From the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt to this day, I have persistently sent all my servants the prophets to them, day after day. Yet they did not listen to me or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck. They did worse than their fathers.\n“So you shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you. You shall call to them, but they will not answer you. And you shall say to them, ‘This is the nation that did not obey the voice of the LORD their God, and did not accept discipline; truth has perished; it is cut off from their lips.\n\n“‘Cut off your hair and cast it away;\nraise a lamentation on the bare heights,\nfor the LORD has rejected and forsaken\nthe generation of his wrath.’\n\n“For the sons of Judah have done evil in my sight, declares the LORD. They have set their detestable things in the house that is called by my name, to defile it. And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command, nor did it come into my mind. Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when it will no more be called Topheth, or the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter; for they will bury in Topheth, because there is no room elsewhere. And the dead bodies of this people will be food for the birds of the air, and for the beasts of the earth, and none will frighten them away. And I will silence in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, for the land shall become a waste.",

To whom has the mouth of the LORD spoken, that he may declare it? Why is the land ruined and laid waste like a wilderness, so that no one passes through? And the LORD says: “Because they have forsaken my law that I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice or walked in accord with it, but have stubbornly followed their own hearts and have gone after the Baals, as their fathers taught them. Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will feed this people with bitter food, and give them poisonous water to drink. I will scatter them among the nations whom neither they nor their fathers have known, and I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them.”\n\nThus says the LORD of hosts:\n“Consider, and call for the mourning women to come;\nsend for the skillful women to come;\nlet them make haste and raise a wailing over us,\nthat our eyes may run down with tears\nand our eyelids flow with water.\nFor a sound of wailing is heard from Zion:\n‘How we are ruined!\nWe are utterly shamed,\nbecause we have left the land,\nbecause they have cast down our dwellings.’”\n\nHear, O women, the word of the LORD,\nand let your ear receive the word of his mouth;\nteach to your daughters a lament,\nand each to her neighbor a dirge.\nFor death has come up into our windows;\nit has entered our palaces,\ncutting off the children from the streets\nand the young men from the squares.\nSpeak: “Thus declares the LORD,\n‘The dead bodies of men shall fall\nlike dung upon the open field,\nlike sheaves after the reaper,\nand none shall gather them.’”\n\nThus says the LORD: “Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast in his riches, but let him who boasts boast in this, that he understands and knows me, that I am the LORD who practices steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth. For in these things I delight, declares the LORD.”\n“Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will punish all those who are circumcised merely in the flesh— Egypt, Judah, Edom, the sons of Ammon, Moab, and all who dwell in the desert who cut the corners of their hair, for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.”",

Behold, it comes!—\na great commotion out of the north country\nto make the cities of Judah a desolation,\na lair of jackals.\n\nI know, O LORD, that the way of man is not in himself,\nthat it is not in man who walks to direct his steps.\nCorrect me, O LORD, but in justice;\nnot in your anger, lest you bring me to nothing.\n\nPour out your wrath on the nations that know you not,\nand on the peoples that call not on your name,\nfor they have devoured Jacob;\nthey have devoured him and consumed him,\nand have laid waste his habitation.",

You shall say to them, Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Cursed be the man who does not hear the words of this covenant that I commanded your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Listen to my voice, and do all that I command you. So shall you be my people, and I will be your God, that I may confirm the oath that I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day.” Then I answered, “So be it, LORD.”\nAnd the LORD said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: Hear the words of this covenant and do them. For I solemnly warned your fathers when I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, warning them persistently, even to this day, saying, Obey my voice. Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but everyone walked in the stubbornness of his evil heart. Therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not.”\nAgain the LORD said to me, “A conspiracy exists among the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words. They have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant that I made with their fathers. Therefore, thus says the LORD, Behold, I am bringing disaster upon them that they cannot escape. Though they cry to me, I will not listen to them. Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to whom they make offerings, but they cannot save them in the time of their trouble. For your gods have become as many as your cities, O Judah, and as many as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to shame, altars to make offerings to Baal.\n“Therefore do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer on their behalf, for I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their trouble. What right has my beloved in my house, when she has done many vile deeds? Can even sacrificial flesh avert your doom? Can you then exult? The LORD once called you ‘a green olive tree, beautiful with good fruit.’ But with the roar of a great tempest he will set fire to it, and its branches will be consumed. The LORD of hosts, who planted you, has decreed disaster against you, because of the evil that the house of Israel and the house of Judah have done, provoking me to anger by making offerings to Baal.”\n\nThe LORD made it known to me and I knew;\nthen you showed me their deeds.\nBut I was like a gentle lamb\nled to the slaughter.\nI did not know it was against me\nthey devised schemes, saying,\n“Let us destroy the tree with its fruit,\nlet us cut him off from the land of the living,\nthat his name be remembered no more.”\nBut, O LORD of hosts, who judges righteously,\nwho tests the heart and the mind,\nlet me see your vengeance upon them,\nfor to you have I committed my cause.\n\nTherefore thus says the LORD concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, and say, “Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD, or you will die by our hand”— therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: “Behold, I will punish them.

And the word of the LORD came to me a second time, “Take the loincloth that you have bought, which is around your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.” So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me. And after many days the LORD said to me, “Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take from there the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there.” Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and I took the loincloth from the place where I had hidden it. And behold, the loincloth was spoiled; it was good for nothing.\nThen the word of the LORD came to me: “Thus says the LORD: Even so will I spoil the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem. This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who stubbornly follow their own heart and have gone after other gods to serve them and worship them, shall be like this loincloth, which is good for nothing. For as the loincloth clings to the waist of a man, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me, declares the LORD, that they might be for me a people, a name, a praise, and a glory, but they would not listen.\n\n“You shall speak to them this word: ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, “Every jar shall be filled with wine.”’ And they will say to you, ‘Do we not indeed know that every jar will be filled with wine?’ Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD: Behold, I will fill with drunkenness all the inhabitants of this land: the kings who sit on David’s throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And I will dash them one against another, fathers and sons together, declares the LORD. I will not pity or spare or have compassion, that I should not destroy them.’”\n\nHear and give ear; be not proud,\nfor the LORD has spoken.\nGive glory to the LORD your God\nbefore he brings darkness,\nbefore your feet stumble\non the twilight mountains,\nand while you look for light\nhe turns it into gloom\nand makes it deep darkness.\nBut if you will not listen,\nmy soul will weep in secret for your pride;\nmy eyes will weep bitterly and run down with tears,\nbecause the LORD’s flock has been taken captive.\n\nSay to the king and the queen mother:\n“Take a lowly seat,\nfor your beautiful crown\nhas come down from your head.”\nThe cities of the Negeb are shut up,\nwith none to open them;\nall Judah is taken into exile,\nwholly taken into exile.\n\n“Lift up your eyes and see\nthose who come from the north.\nWhere is the flock that was given you,\nyour beautiful flock?\nWhat will you say when they set as head over you\nthose whom you yourself have taught to be friends to you?\nWill not pangs take hold of you\nlike those of a woman in labor?\nAnd if you say in your heart,\n‘Why have these things come upon me?’\nit is for the greatness of your iniquity\nthat your skirts are lifted up\nand you suffer violence.\nCan the Ethiopian change his skin\nor the leopard his spots?\nThen also you can do good\nwho are accustomed to do evil.\nI will scatter you like chaff\ndriven by the wind from the desert.\nThis is your lot,\nthe portion I have measured out to you, declares the LORD,\nbecause you have forgotten me\nand trusted in lies.\nI myself will lift up your skirts over your face,\nand your shame will be seen.\nI have seen your abominations,\nyour adulteries and neighings, your lewd whorings,\non the hills in the field.\nWoe to you, O Jerusalem!\nHow long will it be before you are made clean?”",

Though they fast, I will not hear their cry, and though they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I will not accept them. But I will consume them by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.”\n\nThen I said: “Ah, Lord GOD, behold, the prophets say to them, ‘You shall not see the sword, nor shall you have famine, but I will give you assured peace in this place.’” And the LORD said to me: “The prophets are prophesying lies in my name. I did not send them, nor did I command them or speak to them. They are prophesying to you a lying vision, worthless divination, and the deceit of their own minds. Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name although I did not send them, and who say, ‘Sword and famine shall not come upon this land’: By sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed. And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem, victims of famine and sword, with none to bury them—them, their wives, their sons, and their daughters. For I will pour out their evil upon them.\n\n“You shall say to them this word:\n‘Let my eyes run down with tears night and day,\nand let them not cease,\nfor the virgin daughter of my people is shattered with a great wound,\nwith a very grievous blow.\nIf I go out into the field,\nbehold, those pierced by the sword!\nAnd if I enter the city,\nbehold, the diseases of famine!\nFor both prophet and priest ply their trade through the land\nand have no knowledge.’”\n\nHave you utterly rejected Judah?\nDoes your soul loathe Zion?\nWhy have you struck us down\nso that there is no healing for us?\nWe looked for peace, but no good came;\nfor a time of healing, but behold, terror.\nWe acknowledge our wickedness, O LORD,\nand the iniquity of our fathers,\nfor we have sinned against you.\nDo not spurn us, for your name’s sake;\ndo not dishonor your glorious throne;\nremember and do not break your covenant with us.\nAre there any among the false gods of the nations that can bring rain?\nOr can the heavens give showers?\nAre you not he, O LORD our God?\nWe set our hope on you,\nfor you do all these things.",

And I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what Manasseh the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem.\n\n“Who will have pity on you, O Jerusalem,\nor who will grieve for you?\nWho will turn aside\nto ask about your welfare?\nYou have rejected me, declares the LORD;\nyou keep going backward,\nso I have stretched out my hand against you and destroyed you—\nI am weary of relenting.\nI have winnowed them with a winnowing fork\nin the gates of the land;\nI have bereaved them; I have destroyed my people;\nthey did not turn from their ways.\nI have made their widows more in number\nthan the sand of the seas;\nI have brought against the mothers of young men\na destroyer at noonday;\nI have made anguish and terror\nfall upon them suddenly.\nShe who bore seven has grown feeble;\nshe has fainted away;\nher sun went down while it was yet day;\nshe has been shamed and disgraced.\nAnd the rest of them I will give to the sword\nbefore their enemies,\ndeclares the LORD.”\n\nWoe is me, my mother, that you bore me, a man of strife and contention to the whole land! I have not lent, nor have I borrowed, yet all of them curse me. The LORD said, “Have I not set you free for their good? Have I not pleaded for you before the enemy in the time of trouble and in the time of distress? Can one break iron, iron from the north, and bronze?\n“Your wealth and your treasures I will give as spoil, without price, for all your sins, throughout all your territory. I will make you serve your enemies in a land that you do not know, for in my anger a fire is kindled that shall burn forever.”\n\nO LORD, you know;\nremember me and visit me,\nand take vengeance for me on my persecutors.\nIn your forbearance take me not away;\nknow that for your sake I bear reproach.\nYour words were found, and I ate them,\nand your words became to me a joy\nand the delight of my heart,\nfor I am called by your name,\nO LORD, God of hosts.\nI did not sit in the company of revelers,\nnor did I rejoice;\nI sat alone, because your hand was upon me,\nfor you had filled me with indignation.\nWhy is my pain unceasing,\nmy wound incurable,\nrefusing to be healed?\nWill you be to me like a deceitful brook,\nlike waters that fail?\n\nTherefore thus says the LORD:\n“If you return, I will restore you,\nand you shall stand before me.\nIf you utter what is precious, and not what is worthless,\nyou shall be as my mouth.\nThey shall turn to you,\nbut you shall not turn to them.\nAnd I will make you to this people\na fortified wall of bronze;\nthey will fight against you,\nbut they shall not prevail over you,\nfor I am with you\nto save you and deliver you,\ndeclares the LORD.\nI will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked,\nand redeem you from the grasp of the ruthless.”",

For thus says the LORD concerning the sons and daughters who are born in this place, and concerning the mothers who bore them and the fathers who fathered them in this land: They shall die of deadly diseases. They shall not be lamented, nor shall they be buried. They shall be as dung on the surface of the ground. They shall perish by the sword and by famine, and their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and for the beasts of the earth.\n“For thus says the LORD: Do not enter the house of mourning, or go to lament or grieve for them, for I have taken away my peace from this people, my steadfast love and mercy, declares the LORD. Both great and small shall die in this land. They shall not be buried, and no one shall lament for them or cut himself or make himself bald for them. No one shall break bread for the mourner, to comfort him for the dead, nor shall anyone give him the cup of consolation to drink for his father or his mother. You shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and drink. For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will silence in this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.\n“And when you tell this people all these words, and they say to you, ‘Why has the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? What is our iniquity? What is the sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?’ then you shall say to them: ‘Because your fathers have forsaken me, declares the LORD, and have gone after other gods and have served and worshiped them, and have forsaken me and have not kept my law, and because you have done worse than your fathers, for behold, every one of you follows his stubborn, evil will, refusing to listen to me. Therefore I will hurl you out of this land into a land that neither you nor your fathers have known, and there you shall serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.’\nLORD\n“Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when it shall no longer be said, ‘As the LORD lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt,’ but ‘As the LORD lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the north country and out of all the countries where he had driven them.’ For I will bring them back to their own land that I gave to their fathers.\n“Behold, I am sending for many fishers, declares the LORD, and they shall catch them. And afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain and every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks. For my eyes are on all their ways. They are not hidden from me, nor is their iniquity concealed from my eyes. But first I will doubly repay their iniquity and their sin, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable idols, and have filled my inheritance with their abominations.”\n\nO LORD, my strength and my stronghold,\nmy refuge in the day of trouble,\nto you shall the nations come\nfrom the ends of the earth and say:\n“Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies,\nworthless things in which there is no profit.\nCan man make for himself gods?\nSuch are not gods!”\n\n“Therefore, behold, I will make them know, this once I will make them know my power and my might, and they shall know that my name is the LORD.”",

Your wealth and all your treasures I will give for spoil as the price of your high places for sin throughout all your territory. You shall loosen your hand from your heritage that I gave to you, and I will make you serve your enemies in a land that you do not know, for in my anger a fire is kindled that shall burn forever.”\n\nThus says the LORD:\n“Cursed is the man who trusts in man\nand makes flesh his strength,\nwhose heart turns away from the LORD.\nHe is like a shrub in the desert,\nand shall not see any good come.\nHe shall dwell in the parched places of the wilderness,\nin an uninhabited salt land.\n\n“Blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD,\nwhose trust is the LORD.\nHe is like a tree planted by water,\nthat sends out its roots by the stream,\nand does not fear when heat comes,\nfor its leaves remain green,\nand is not anxious in the year of drought,\nfor it does not cease to bear fruit.”\n\nThe heart is deceitful above all things,\nand desperately sick;\nwho can understand it?\n“I the LORD search the heart\nand test the mind,\nto give every man according to his ways,\naccording to the fruit of his deeds.”\n\nLike the partridge that gathers a brood that she did not hatch,\nso is he who gets riches but not by justice;\nin the midst of his days they will leave him,\nand at his end he will be a fool.\n\nA glorious throne set on high from the beginning\nis the place of our sanctuary.\nO LORD, the hope of Israel,\nall who forsake you shall be put to shame;\nthose who turn away from you shall be written in the earth,\nfor they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living water.\n\nHeal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed;\nsave me, and I shall be saved,\nfor you are my praise.\nBehold, they say to me,\n“Where is the word of the LORD?\nLet it come!”\nI have not run away from being your shepherd,\nnor have I desired the day of sickness.\nYou know what came out of my lips;\nit was before your face.\nBe not a terror to me;\nyou are my refuge in the day of disaster.\nLet those be put to shame who persecute me,\nbut let me not be put to shame;\nlet them be dismayed,\nbut let me not be dismayed;\nbring upon them the day of disaster;\ndestroy them with double destruction!\n\nThus said the LORD to me: “Go and stand in the People’s Gate, by which the kings of Judah enter and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem, and say: ‘Hear the word of the LORD, you kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who enter by these gates. Thus says the LORD: Take care for the sake of your lives, and do not bear a burden on the Sabbath day or bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem. And do not carry a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath or do any work, but keep the Sabbath day holy, as I commanded your fathers. Yet they did not listen or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck, that they might not hear and receive instruction.\n“‘But if you listen to me, declares the LORD, and bring in no burden by the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, but keep the Sabbath day holy and do no work on it, then there shall enter by the gates of this city kings and princes who sit on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their officials, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And this city shall be inhabited forever. And people shall come from the cities of Judah and the places around Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin, from the Shephelah, from the hill country, and from the Negeb, bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and frankincense, and bringing thank offerings to the house of the LORD. But if you do not listen to me, to keep the Sabbath day holy, and not to bear a burden and enter by the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in its gates, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem and shall not be quenched.’”",

And the vessel he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter’s hand, and he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to do.\nThen the word of the LORD came to me: “O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter has done? declares the LORD. Behold, like the clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel. If at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it, and if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, I will relent of the disaster that I intended to do to it. And if at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will build and plant it, and if it does evil in my sight, not listening to my voice, then I will relent of the good that I had intended to do to it. Now, therefore, say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: ‘Thus says the LORD, Behold, I am shaping disaster against you and devising a plan against you. Return, every one from his evil way, and amend your ways and your deeds.’\n“But they say, ‘That is in vain! We will follow our own plans, and will every one act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.’\n\n“Therefore thus says the LORD:\nAsk among the nations,\nWho has heard the like of this?\nThe virgin Israel\nhas done a very horrible thing.\nDoes the snow of Lebanon leave\nthe crags of Sirion?\nDo the mountain waters run dry,\nthe cold flowing streams?\nBut my people have forgotten me;\nthey make offerings to false gods;\nthey made them stumble in their ways,\nin the ancient roads,\nand to walk into side roads,\nnot the highway,\nmaking their land a horror,\na thing to be hissed at forever.\nEveryone who passes by it is horrified\nand shakes his head.\nLike the east wind I will scatter them\nbefore the enemy.\nI will show them my back, not my face,\nin the day of their calamity.”\n\nThen they said, “Come, let us make plots against Jeremiah, for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, let us strike him with the tongue, and let us not pay attention to any of his words.”\n\nHear me, O LORD,\nand listen to the voice of my adversaries.\nShould good be repaid with evil?\nYet they have dug a pit for my life.\nRemember how I stood before you\nto speak good for them,\nto turn away your wrath from them.\nTherefore deliver up their children to famine;\ngive them over to the power of the sword;\nlet their wives become childless and widowed.\nMay their men meet death by pestilence,\ntheir youths be struck down by the sword in battle.\nMay a cry be heard from their houses,\nwhen you bring the plunderer suddenly upon them!\nFor they have dug a pit to take me\nand laid snares for my feet.\nYet you, O LORD, know\nall their plotting to kill me.\nForgive not their iniquity,\nnor blot out their sin from your sight.\nLet them be overthrown before you;\ndeal with them in the time of your anger.",

You shall say, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing such disaster upon this place that the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle. Because the people have forsaken me and have profaned this place by making offerings in it to other gods whom neither they nor their fathers nor the kings of Judah have known; and because they have filled this place with the blood of innocents, and have built the high places of Baal to burn their sons in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, which I did not command or decree, nor did it come into my mind— therefore, behold, days are coming, declares the LORD, when this place shall no more be called Topheth, or the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter. And in this place I will make void the plans of Judah and Jerusalem, and will cause their people to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those who seek their life. I will give their dead bodies for food to the birds of the air and to the beasts of the earth. And I will make this city a horror, a thing to be hissed at. Everyone who passes by it will be horrified and will hiss because of all its wounds. And I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and their daughters, and everyone shall eat the flesh of his neighbor in the siege and in the distress, with which their enemies and those who seek their life afflict them.’\n“Then you shall break the flask in the sight of the men who go with you, and shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts: So will I break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter’s vessel, so that it can never be mended. Men shall bury in Topheth because there will be no place else to bury. Thus will I do to this place, declares the LORD, and to its inhabitants, making this city like Topheth. The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah—all the houses on whose roofs offerings have been offered to all the host of heaven, and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods—shall be defiled like the place of Topheth.’”\nThen Jeremiah came from Topheth, where the LORD had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the court of the LORD’s house and said to all the people: “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, behold, I am bringing upon this city and upon all its towns all the disaster that I have pronounced against it, because they have stiffened their neck, refusing to hear my words.”",

Then Pashhur beat Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper Benjamin Gate of the house of the LORD. The next day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “The LORD does not call your name Pashhur, but Terror on Every Side. For thus says the LORD: Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They shall fall by the sword of their enemies while you look on. And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon. He shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall strike them down with the sword. Moreover, I will give all the wealth of the city, all its gains, all its prized belongings, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies, who shall plunder them and seize them and carry them to Babylon. And you, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house, shall go into captivity. To Babylon you shall go, and there you shall die, and there you shall be buried, you and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely.”\n\nO LORD, you have deceived me,\nand I was deceived;\nyou are stronger than I,\nand you have prevailed.\nI have become a laughingstock all the day;\neveryone mocks me.\nFor whenever I speak, I cry out,\nI shout, “Violence and destruction!”\nFor the word of the LORD has become for me\na reproach and derision all day long.\nIf I say, “I will not mention him,\nor speak any more in his name,”\nthere is in my heart as it were a burning fire\nshut up in my bones,\nand I am weary with holding it in,\nand I cannot.\nFor I hear many whispering.\nTerror is on every side!\n“Denounce him! Let us denounce him!”\nsay all my close friends,\nwatching for my fall.\n“Perhaps he will be deceived;\nthen we can overcome him\nand take our revenge on him.”\nBut the LORD is with me as a dread warrior;\ntherefore my persecutors will stumble;\nthey will not overcome me.\nThey will be greatly shamed,\nfor they will not succeed.\nTheir eternal dishonor\nwill never be forgotten.\nO LORD of hosts, who tests the righteous,\nwho sees the heart and the mind,\nlet me see your vengeance upon them,\nfor to you have I committed my cause.\n\nSing to the LORD;\npraise the LORD!\nFor he has delivered the life of the needy\nfrom the hand of evildoers.\n\nCursed be the day\non which I was born!\nThe day when my mother bore me,\nlet it not be blessed!\nCursed be the man who brought the news to my father,\n“A son is born to you,”\nmaking him very glad.\nLet that man be like the cities\nthat the LORD overthrew without pity;\nlet him hear a cry in the morning\nand an alarm at noon,\nbecause he did not kill me in the womb;\nso my mother would have been my grave,\nand her womb forever great.\nWhy did I come out from the womb\nto see toil and sorrow,\nand spend my days in shame?",

Perhaps the LORD will deal with us according to all his wonderful deeds and will make him withdraw from us.”\nThen Jeremiah said to them: “Thus you shall say to Zedekiah, ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands and with which you are fighting against the king of Babylon and against the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the walls. And I will bring them together into the midst of this city. I myself will fight against you with outstretched hand and strong arm, in anger and in fury and in great wrath. And I will strike down the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast. They shall die of a great pestilence. Afterward, declares the LORD, I will give Zedekiah king of Judah and his servants and the people in this city who survive the pestilence, sword, and famine into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of their enemies, into the hand of those who seek their lives. He shall strike them down with the edge of the sword. He shall not pity them or spare them or have compassion.’\n“And to this people you shall say: ‘Thus says the LORD: Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death. He who stays in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, but he who goes out and surrenders to the Chaldeans who are besieging you shall live and shall have his life as a prize of war. For I have set my face against this city for harm and not for good, declares the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.’\n\n“And to the house of the king of Judah say, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, O house of David!

For thus says the LORD concerning the house of the king of Judah:\n\n“‘You are like Gilead to me,\nlike the summit of Lebanon,\nyet surely I will make you a desert,\nan uninhabited city.\nI will prepare destroyers against you,\neach with his weapons,\nand they shall cut down your choicest cedars\nand cast them into the fire.\n\n“‘And many nations will pass by this city, and every man will say to his neighbor, “Why has the LORD dealt thus with this great city?” And they will answer, “Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God and worshiped other gods and served them.”’”\n\nWeep not for him who is dead,\nnor grieve for him,\nbut weep bitterly for him who goes away,\nfor he shall return no more\nto see his native land.\n\nFor thus says the LORD concerning Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, and who went away from this place: “He shall return here no more, but in the place where they have carried him captive, there shall he die, and he shall never see this land again.”\n\n“Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness,\nand his upper rooms by injustice,\nwho makes his neighbor serve him for nothing\nand does not give him his wages,\nwho says, ‘I will build myself a great house\nwith spacious upper rooms,’\nwho cuts out windows for it,\npaneling it with cedar\nand painting it with vermilion.\nDo you think you are a king\nbecause you compete in cedar?\nDid not your father eat and drink\nand do justice and righteousness?\nThen it was well with him.\nHe judged the cause of the poor and needy;\nthen it was well.\nIs not this to know me?\ndeclares the LORD.\nBut you have eyes and heart\nonly for your dishonest gain,\nfor shedding innocent blood,\nand for practicing oppression and violence.”\n\nTherefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:\n\n“They shall not lament for him, saying,\n‘Ah, my brother!’ or ‘Ah, sister!’\nThey shall not lament for him, saying,\n‘Ah, lord!’ or ‘Ah, his majesty!’\nWith the burial of a donkey he shall be buried,\ndragged and dumped beyond the gates of Jerusalem.”\n\n“Go up to Lebanon, and cry out,\nand lift up your voice in Bashan;\ncry out from Abarim,\nfor all your lovers are destroyed.\nI spoke to you in your prosperity,\nbut you said, ‘I will not listen.’\nThis has been your way from your youth,\nthat you have not obeyed my voice.\nThe wind shall shepherd all your shepherds,\nand your lovers shall go into captivity;\nthen you will be ashamed and confounded\nbecause of all your evil.\nO inhabitant of Lebanon,\nnested among the cedars,\nhow you will be pitied when pangs come upon you,\npain as of a woman in labor!”\n\n“As I live, declares the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were the signet ring on my right hand, yet I would tear you off and give you into the hand of those who seek your life, into the hand of those of whom you are afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans. I will hurl you and the mother who bore you into another country, where you were not born, and there you shall die. But to the land to which they will long to return, there they shall not return.”\n\nIs this man Coniah a despised, broken pot,\na vessel no one cares for?\nWhy are he and his children hurled and cast\ninto a land that they do not know?\nO land, land, land,\nhear the word of the LORD!\nThus says the LORD:\n“Write this man down as childless,\na man who shall not succeed in his days,\nfor none of his offspring shall succeed\nin sitting on the throne of David\nand ruling again in Judah.”",

      "chapter_text": "“Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!” declares the LORD. Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who care for my people: “You have scattered my flock and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. Behold, I will attend to you for your evil deeds, declares the LORD. Then I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply. I will set shepherds over them who will care for them, and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be missing, declares the LORD.\n“Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. And this is the name by which he will be called: ‘The LORD is our righteousness.’\n“Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when they shall no longer say, ‘As the LORD lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt,’ but ‘As the LORD lives who brought up and led the offspring of the house of Israel out of the north country and out of all the countries where he had driven them.’ Then they shall dwell in their own land.”\n\nConcerning the prophets:\n\nMy heart is broken within me;\nall my bones shake;\nI am like a drunken man,\nlike a man overcome by wine,\nbecause of the LORD\nand because of his holy words.\nFor the land is full of adulterers;\nbecause of the curse the land mourns,\nand the pastures of the wilderness are dried up.\nTheir course is evil,\nand their might is not right.\n“Both prophet and priest are ungodly;\neven in my house I have found their evil,\ndeclares the LORD.\nTherefore their way shall be to them\nlike slippery paths in the darkness,\ninto which they shall be driven and fall,\nfor I will bring disaster upon them\nin the year of their punishment,\ndeclares the LORD.\nIn the prophets of Samaria\nI saw an unsavory thing:\nthey prophesied by Baal\nand led my people Israel astray.\nBut in the prophets of Jerusalem\nI have seen a horrible thing:\nthey commit adultery and walk in lies;\nthey strengthen the hands of evildoers,\nso that no one turns from his evil;\nall of them have become like Sodom to me,\nand its inhabitants like Gomorrah.”\nTherefore thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets:\n“Behold, I will feed them with bitter food\nand give them poisoned water to drink,\nfor from the prophets of Jerusalem\nungodliness has gone out into all the land.”\n\nThus says the LORD of hosts: “Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you, filling you with vain hopes. They speak visions of their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD. They say continually to those who despise the word of the LORD, ‘It shall be well with you’; and to everyone who stubbornly follows his own heart, they say, ‘No disaster shall come upon you.’”\n\nFor who among them has stood in the council of the LORD\nto see and to hear his word,\nor who has paid attention to his word and listened?\nBehold, the storm of the LORD!\nWrath has gone forth,\na whirling tempest;\nit will burst upon the head of the wicked.\nThe anger of the LORD will not turn back\nuntil he has executed and accomplished\nthe intents of his heart.\nIn the latter days you will understand it clearly.\n\n“I did not send the prophets,\nyet they ran;\nI did not speak to them,\nyet they prophesied.\nBut if they had stood in my council,\nthen they would have proclaimed my words to my people,\nand they would have turned them from their evil way,\nand from the evil of their deeds.\n\n“Am I a God at hand, declares the LORD, and not a God far away? Can a man hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him? declares the LORD. Do I not fill heaven and earth? declares the LORD. I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in my name, saying, ‘I have dreamed, I have dreamed!’ How long shall there be lies in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies, and who prophesy the deceit of their own heart, who think to make my people forget my name by their dreams that they tell one another, even as their fathers forgot my name for Baal? Let the prophet who has a dream tell the dream, but let him who has my word speak my word faithfully. What has straw in common with wheat? declares the LORD. Is not my word like fire, declares the LORD, and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces? Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, declares the LORD, who steal my words from one another. Behold, I am against the prophets, declares the LORD, who use their tongues and declare, ‘declares the LORD.’ Behold, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, declares the LORD, and who tell them and lead my people astray by their lies and their recklessness, when I did not send them or charge them. So they do not profit this people at all, declares the LORD.\n“When one of this people, or a prophet or a priest asks you, ‘What is the burden of the LORD?’ you shall say to them, ‘You are the burden, and I will cast you off, declares the LORD.’ And as for the prophet, priest, or one of the people who says, ‘The burden of the LORD,’ I will punish that man and his household. Thus shall you say, every one to his neighbor and every one to his brother, ‘What has the LORD answered?’ or ‘What has the LORD spoken?’ But ‘the burden of the LORD’ you shall mention no more, for the burden is every man’s own word, and you pervert the words of the living God, the LORD of hosts, our God. Thus you shall say to the prophet, ‘What has the LORD answered you?’ or ‘What has the LORD spoken?’ But if you say, ‘The burden of the LORD,’ thus says the LORD, ‘Because you have said these words, “The burden of the LORD,” when I sent to you, saying, “You shall not say, ‘The burden of the LORD,’” therefore, behold, I will surely lift you up and cast you away from my presence, you and the city that I gave to you and your fathers. And I will bring upon you everlasting reproach and perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.’”",

One basket had very good figs, like first-ripe figs, but the other basket had very bad figs, so bad that they could not be eaten. And the LORD said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” I said, “Figs, the good figs very good, and the bad figs very bad, so bad that they cannot be eaten.”\nThen the word of the LORD came to me: “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Like these good figs, so I will regard as good the exiles from Judah, whom I have sent away from this place to the land of the Chaldeans. I will set my eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this land. I will build them up, and not tear them down; I will plant them, and not pluck them up. I will give them a heart to know that I am the LORD, and they shall be my people and I will be their God, for they shall return to me with their whole heart.\n“But thus says the LORD: Like the bad figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten, so will I treat Zedekiah the king of Judah, his officials, the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the land of Egypt. I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a reproach, a byword, a taunt, and a curse in all the places where I shall drive them. And I will send sword, famine, and pestilence upon them, until they shall be utterly destroyed from the land that I gave to them and their fathers.”",

      "chapter_text": "The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: “For twenty-three years, from the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, to this day, the word of the LORD has come to me, and I have spoken persistently to you, but you have not listened. You have neither listened nor inclined your ears to hear, although the LORD persistently sent to you all his servants the prophets, saying, ‘Turn now, every one of you, from his evil way and evil deeds, and dwell upon the land that the LORD has given to you and your fathers from of old and forever. Do not go after other gods to serve and worship them, or provoke me to anger with the work of your hands. Then I will do you no harm.’ Yet you have not listened to me, declares the LORD, that you might provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own harm.\n“Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: Because you have not obeyed my words, behold, I will send for all the tribes of the north, declares the LORD, and for Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants, and against all these surrounding nations. I will devote them to destruction, and make them a horror, a hissing, and an everlasting desolation. Moreover, I will banish from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the grinding of the millstones and the light of the lamp. This whole land shall become a ruin and a waste, and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years. Then after seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their iniquity, declares the LORD, making the land an everlasting waste. I will bring upon that land all the words that I have uttered against it, everything written in this book, which Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations. For many nations and great kings shall make slaves even of them, and I will recompense them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.”\nLORD\nThus the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me: “Take from my hand this cup of the wine of wrath, and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it. They shall drink and stagger and be crazed because of the sword that I am sending among them.”\nSo I took the cup from the LORD’s hand, and made all the nations to whom the LORD sent me drink it: Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, its kings and officials, to make them a desolation and a waste, a hissing and a curse, as at this day; Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his officials, all his people, and all the mixed tribes among them; all the kings of the land of Uz and all the kings of the land of the Philistines (Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod); Edom, Moab, and the sons of Ammon; all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the coastland across the sea; Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who cut the corners of their hair; all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the mixed tribes who dwell in the desert; all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media; all the kings of the north, far and near, one after another, and all the kingdoms of the world that are on the face of the earth. And after them the king of Babylon shall drink.\n“Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Drink, be drunk and vomit, fall and rise no more, because of the sword that I am sending among you.’\n“And if they refuse to accept the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts: You must drink! For behold, I begin to work disaster at the city that is called by my name, and shall you go unpunished? You shall not go unpunished, for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth, declares the LORD of hosts.’\n“You, therefore, shall prophesy against them all these words, and say to them:\n\n“‘The LORD will roar from on high,\nand from his holy habitation utter his voice;\nhe will roar mightily against his fold,\nand shout, like those who tread grapes,\nagainst all the inhabitants of the earth.\nThe clamor will resound to the ends of the earth,\nfor the LORD has an indictment against the nations;\nhe is entering into judgment with all flesh,\nand the wicked he will put to the sword,\ndeclares the LORD.’\n\n“Thus says the LORD of hosts:\nBehold, disaster is going forth\nfrom nation to nation,\nand a great tempest is stirring\nfrom the farthest parts of the earth!\n\n“And those pierced by the LORD on that day shall extend from one end of the earth to the other. They shall not be lamented, or gathered, or buried; they shall be dung on the surface of the ground.\n\n“Wail, you shepherds, and cry out,\nand roll in ashes, you lords of the flock,\nfor the days of your slaughter and dispersion have come,\nand you shall fall like a choice vessel.\nNo refuge will remain for the shepherds,\nnor escape for the lords of the flock.\nA voice—the cry of the shepherds,\nand the wail of the lords of the flock!\nFor the LORD is laying waste their pasture,\nand the peaceful folds are devastated\nbecause of the fierce anger of the LORD.\nLike a lion he has left his lair,\nfor their land has become a waste\nbecause of the sword of the oppressor,\nand because of his fierce anger.”",

It may be they will listen, and every one turn from his evil way, that I may relent of the disaster that I intend to do to them because of their evil deeds. You shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD: If you will not listen to me, to walk in my law that I have set before you, and to listen to the words of my servants the prophets whom I send to you urgently, though you have not listened, then I will make this house like Shiloh, and I will make this city a curse for all the nations of the earth.’”\nThe priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD. And when Jeremiah had finished speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak to all the people, then the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold of him, saying, “You shall die! Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, ‘This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant’?” And all the people gathered around Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.\nWhen the officials of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king’s house to the house of the LORD and took their seat in the entry of the New Gate of the house of the LORD. Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and to all the people, “This man deserves the sentence of death, because he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own ears.”\nThen Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and all the people, saying, “The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the words you have heard. Now therefore mend your ways and your deeds, and obey the voice of the LORD your God, and the LORD will relent of the disaster that he has pronounced against you. But as for me, behold, I am in your hands. Do with me as seems good and right to you. Only know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and its inhabitants, for in truth the LORD sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.”\n\nThen the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, “This man does not deserve the sentence of death, for he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.” And certain of the elders of the land arose and spoke to all the assembled people, saying, “Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and said to all the people of Judah: ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts,\n\n“‘Zion shall be plowed as a field;\nJerusalem shall become a heap of ruins,\nand the mountain of the house a wooded height.’\n\nDid Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? Did he not fear the LORD and entreat the favor of the LORD, and did not the LORD relent of the disaster that he had pronounced against them? But we are about to bring great disaster upon ourselves.”\nThere was another man who prophesied in the name of the LORD, Uriah the son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim. He prophesied against this city and against this land in words like those of Jeremiah. And when King Jehoiakim, with all his warriors and all the officials, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death. But when Uriah heard of it, he was afraid and fled and escaped to Egypt. Then King Jehoiakim sent to Egypt certain men, Elnathan the son of Achbor and others with him, and they took Uriah from Egypt and brought him to King Jehoiakim, who struck him down with the sword and dumped his dead body into the burial place of the common people.\nBut the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah so that he was not given over to the people to be put to death.",

Thus the LORD said to me: “Make yourself straps and yoke-bars, and put them on your neck. Send word to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the sons of Ammon, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon by the hand of the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah. Give them this charge for their masters: ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: This is what you shall say to your masters: “It is I who by my great power and my outstretched arm have made the earth, with the men and animals that are on the earth, and I give it to whomever it seems right to me. Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant, and I have given him also the beasts of the field to serve him. All the nations shall serve him and his son and his grandson, until the time of his own land comes. Then many nations and great kings shall make him their slave.\n“‘“But if any nation or kingdom will not serve this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I will punish that nation with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, declares the LORD, until I have consumed it by his hand. So do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your fortune-tellers, or your sorcerers, who are saying to you, ‘You shall not serve the king of Babylon.’ For it is a lie that they are prophesying to you, with the result that you will be removed far from your land, and I will drive you out, and you will perish. But any nation that will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will leave on its own land, to work it and dwell there, declares the LORD.”’”\nTo Zedekiah king of Judah I spoke in like manner: “Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people and live. Why will you and your people die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, as the LORD has spoken concerning any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are saying to you, ‘You shall not serve the king of Babylon,’ for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you. I have not sent them, declares the LORD, but they are prophesying falsely in my name, with the result that I will drive you out and you will perish, you and the prophets who are prophesying to you.”\nThen I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, “Thus says the LORD: Do not listen to the words of your prophets who are prophesying to you, saying, ‘Behold, the vessels of the LORD’s house will now shortly be brought back from Babylon,’ for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you. Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon and live. Why should this city become a desolation? If they are prophets, and if the word of the LORD is with them, then let them intercede with the LORD of hosts, that the vessels that are left in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem may not go to Babylon. For thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, the sea, the stands, and the rest of the vessels that are left in this city, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take away, when he took into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem— thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem: They shall be carried to Babylon and remain there until the day when I visit them, declares the LORD.

Within two years I will bring back to this place all the vessels of the LORD’s house, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon. I will also bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the exiles from Judah who went to Babylon, declares the LORD, for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.”\nThen the prophet Jeremiah spoke to Hananiah the prophet in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the LORD, and the prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen! May the LORD do so; may the LORD make the words that you have prophesied come true, and bring back to this place from Babylon the vessels of the house of the LORD, and all the exiles. Yet hear now this word that I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people. The prophets who preceded you and me from ancient times prophesied war, famine, and pestilence against many countries and great kingdoms. As for the prophet who prophesies peace, when the word of that prophet comes to pass, then it will be known that the LORD has truly sent the prophet.”\nThen the prophet Hananiah took the yoke-bars from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke them. And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, “Thus says the LORD: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations within two years.” But Jeremiah the prophet went his way.\nSometime after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke-bars from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: “Go, tell Hananiah, ‘Thus says the LORD: You have broken wooden bars, but you have made in their place bars of iron. For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put upon the neck of all these nations an iron yoke to serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they shall serve him, for I have given to him even the beasts of the field.’” And Jeremiah the prophet said to the prophet Hananiah, “Listen, Hananiah, the LORD has not sent you, and you have made this people trust in a lie. Therefore thus says the LORD: ‘Behold, I will remove you from the face of the earth. This year you shall die, because you have uttered rebellion against the LORD.’”\nIn that same year, in the seventh month, the prophet Hananiah died.",

This was after King Jeconiah and the queen mother, the eunuchs, the officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the metal workers had departed from Jerusalem. The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. It said: “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat their produce. Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons, and give your daughters in marriage, that they may bear sons and daughters; multiply there, and do not decrease. But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare. For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Do not let your prophets and your diviners who are among you deceive you, and do not listen to the dreams that they dream, for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you in my name; I did not send them, declares the LORD.\n“For thus says the LORD: When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will visit you, and I will fulfill to you my promise and bring you back to this place. For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will hear you. You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart. I will be found by you, declares the LORD, and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and all the places where I have driven you, declares the LORD, and I will bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile.\n“Because you have said, ‘The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,’ thus says the LORD concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, and concerning all the people who dwell in this city, your kinsmen who did not go out with you into exile: ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, behold, I am sending on them sword, famine, and pestilence, and I will make them like vile figs that are so rotten they cannot be eaten. I will pursue them with sword, famine, and pestilence, and will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, a terror, a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them, because they did not pay attention to my words, declares the LORD, that I persistently sent to you by my servants the prophets, but you would not listen, declares the LORD.’ Hear the word of the LORD, all you exiles whom I sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon: ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying a lie to you in my name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall strike them down before your eyes. Because of them this curse shall be used by all the exiles from Judah in Babylon: “The LORD make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,” because they have done an outrageous thing in Israel, they have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and they have spoken in my name lying words that I did not command them. I am the one who knows, and I am witness, declares the LORD.’”\n\nTo Shemaiah of Nehelam you shall say: “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: You have sent letters in your name to all the people who are in Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying, ‘The LORD has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, to have charge in the house of the LORD over every madman who prophesies, to put him in the stocks and neck irons. Now why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who is prophesying to you? For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, “Your exile will be long; build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their produce.”’”\nZephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet. Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: “Send to all the exiles, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD concerning Shemaiah of Nehelam: Because Shemaiah had prophesied to you when I did not send him, and has made you trust in a lie, therefore thus says the LORD: Behold, I will punish Shemaiah of Nehelam and his descendants. He shall not have anyone living among this people, and he shall not see the good that I will do to my people, declares the LORD, for he has spoken rebellion against the LORD.’”",

For I will satisfy the weary soul, and every languishing soul I will replenish.”\nAt this I awoke and looked, and my sleep was pleasant to me.\n“Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and the seed of beast. And it shall come to pass that as I have watched over them to pluck up and break down, to overthrow, destroy, and bring harm, so I will watch over them to build and to plant, declares the LORD. In those days they shall no longer say:\n\n“‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes,\nand the children’s teeth are set on edge.’\n\nBut everyone shall die for his own iniquity. Each man who eats sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.\n\n“Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the LORD. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, ‘Know the LORD,’ for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the LORD. For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.”\n\nThus says the LORD,\nwho gives the sun for light by day\nand the fixed order of the moon and the stars for light by night,\nwho stirs up the sea so that its waves roar—\nthe LORD of hosts is his name:\n“If this fixed order departs\nfrom before me, declares the LORD,\nthen shall the offspring of Israel cease\nfrom being a nation before me forever.”\n\nThus says the LORD:\n“If the heavens above can be measured,\nand the foundations of the earth below can be explored,\nthen I will cast off all the offspring of Israel\nfor all that they have done,\ndeclares the LORD.”\n\n“Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when the city shall be rebuilt for the LORD from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. And the measuring line shall go out farther, straight to the hill Gareb, and shall then turn to Goah. The whole valley of the dead bodies and the ashes, and all the fields as far as the brook Kidron, to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east, shall be sacred to the LORD. It shall not be plucked up or overthrown anymore forever.”",

      "chapter_text": "The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard that was in the palace of the king of Judah. For Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him, saying, “Why do you prophesy and say, ‘Thus says the LORD: Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall capture it; Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye. And he shall take Zedekiah to Babylon, and there he shall remain until I visit him, declares the LORD. Though you fight against the Chaldeans, you shall not succeed’?”\nJeremiah said, “The word of the LORD came to me: Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you and say, ‘Buy my field that is at Anathoth, for the right of redemption by purchase is yours.’ Then Hanamel my cousin came to me in the court of the guard, in accordance with the word of the LORD, and said to me, ‘Buy my field that is at Anathoth in the land of Benjamin, for the right of possession and redemption is yours; buy it for yourself.’ Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.\n“And I bought the field at Anathoth from Hanamel my cousin, and weighed out the money to him, seventeen shekels of silver. I signed the deed, sealed it, got witnesses, and weighed the money on scales. Then I took the sealed deed of purchase, containing the terms and conditions and the open copy. And I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my cousin, in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, and in the presence of all the Judeans who were sitting in the court of the guard. I charged Baruch in their presence, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, both this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware vessel, that they may last for a long time. For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.’\n\n“After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD, saying: ‘Ah, Lord GOD! It is you who have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm! Nothing is too hard for you. You show steadfast love to thousands, but you repay the guilt of fathers to their children after them, O great and mighty God, whose name is the LORD of hosts, great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are open to all the ways of the children of man, rewarding each one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds. You have shown signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and to this day in Israel and among all mankind, and have made a name for yourself, as at this day. You brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and outstretched arm, and with great terror. And you gave them this land, which you swore to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey. And they entered and took possession of it. But they did not obey your voice or walk in your law. They did nothing of all you commanded them to do. Therefore you have made all this disaster come upon them. Behold, the siege mounds have come up to the city to take it, and because of sword and famine and pestilence the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans who are fighting against it. What you spoke has come to pass, and behold, you see it. Yet you, O Lord GOD, have said to me, “Buy the field for money and get witnesses”—though the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.’”\nThe word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: “Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh. Is anything too hard for me? Therefore, thus says the LORD: Behold, I am giving this city into the hands of the Chaldeans and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall capture it. The Chaldeans who are fighting against this city shall come and set this city on fire and burn it, with the houses on whose roofs offerings have been made to Baal and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods, to provoke me to anger. For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight from their youth. The children of Israel have done nothing but provoke me to anger by the work of their hands, declares the LORD. This city has aroused my anger and wrath, from the day it was built to this day, so that I will remove it from my sight because of all the evil of the children of Israel and the children of Judah that they did to provoke me to anger—their kings and their officials, their priests and their prophets, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. They have turned to me their back and not their face. And though I have taught them persistently, they have not listened to receive instruction. They set up their abominations in the house that is called by my name, to defile it. They built the high places of Baal in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to offer up their sons and daughters to Molech, though I did not command them, nor did it enter into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.\n\n“Now therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, ‘It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword, by famine, and by pestilence’: Behold, I will gather them from all the countries to which I drove them in my anger and my wrath and in great indignation. I will bring them back to this place, and I will make them dwell in safety. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God. I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me forever, for their own good and the good of their children after them. I will make with them an everlasting covenant, that I will not turn away from doing good to them. And I will put the fear of me in their hearts, that they may not turn from me. I will rejoice in doing them good, and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness, with all my heart and all my soul.\n“For thus says the LORD: Just as I have brought all this great disaster upon this people, so I will bring upon them all the good that I promise them. Fields shall be bought in this land of which you are saying, ‘It is a desolation, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’ Fields shall be bought for money, and deeds shall be signed and sealed and witnessed, in the land of Benjamin, in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the Shephelah, and in the cities of the Negeb; for I will restore their fortunes, declares the LORD.”",

      "chapter_text": "LORD\nThe word of the LORD came to Jeremiah a second time, while he was still shut up in the court of the guard: “Thus says the LORD who made the earth, the LORD who formed it to establish it—the LORD is his name: Call to me and I will answer you, and will tell you great and hidden things that you have not known. For thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and the houses of the kings of Judah that were torn down to make a defense against the siege mounds and against the sword: They are coming in to fight against the Chaldeans and to fill them with the dead bodies of men whom I shall strike down in my anger and my wrath, for I have hidden my face from this city because of all their evil. Behold, I will bring to it health and healing, and I will heal them and reveal to them abundance of prosperity and security. I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel, and rebuild them as they were at first. I will cleanse them from all the guilt of their sin against me, and I will forgive all the guilt of their sin and rebellion against me. And this city shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth who shall hear of all the good that I do for them. They shall fear and tremble because of all the good and all the prosperity I provide for it.\n“Thus says the LORD: In this place of which you say, ‘It is a waste without man or beast,’ in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man or inhabitant or beast, there shall be heard again the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voices of those who sing, as they bring thank offerings to the house of the LORD:\n\n“‘Give thanks to the LORD of hosts,\nfor the LORD is good,\nfor his steadfast love endures forever!’\n\nFor I will restore the fortunes of the land as at first, says the LORD.\n“Thus says the LORD of hosts: In this place that is waste, without man or beast, and in all of its cities, there shall again be habitations of shepherds resting their flocks. In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the Shephelah, and in the cities of the Negeb, in the land of Benjamin, the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, flocks shall again pass under the hands of the one who counts them, says the LORD.\nLORD\n“Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will fulfill the promise I made to the house of Israel and the house of Judah. In those days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch to spring up for David, and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will dwell securely. And this is the name by which it will be called: ‘The LORD is our righteousness.’\n“For thus says the LORD: David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel, and the Levitical priests shall never lack a man in my presence to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to make sacrifices forever.”\nThe word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: “Thus says the LORD: If you can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night, so that day and night will not come at their appointed time, then also my covenant with David my servant may be broken, so that he shall not have a son to reign on his throne, and my covenant with the Levitical priests my ministers. As the host of heaven cannot be numbered and the sands of the sea cannot be measured, so I will multiply the offspring of David my servant, and the Levitical priests who minister to me.”\nThe word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: “Have you not observed that these people are saying, ‘The LORD has rejected the two clans that he chose’? Thus they have despised my people so that they are no longer a nation in their sight. Thus says the LORD: If I have not established my covenant with day and night and the fixed order of heaven and earth, then I will reject the offspring of Jacob and David my servant and will not choose one of his offspring to rule over the offspring of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will restore their fortunes and will have mercy on them.”",

You shall not escape from his hand but shall surely be captured and delivered into his hand. You shall see the king of Babylon eye to eye and speak with him face to face. And you shall go to Babylon.’ Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah! Thus says the LORD concerning you: ‘You shall not die by the sword. You shall die in peace. And as spices were burned for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so people shall burn spices for you and lament for you, saying, “Alas, lord!”’ For I have spoken the word, declares the LORD.”\nThen Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem, when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left, Lachish and Azekah, for these were the only fortified cities of Judah that remained.\nThe word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to make a proclamation of liberty to them, that everyone should set free his Hebrew slaves, male and female, so that no one should enslave a Jew, his brother. And they obeyed, all the officials and all the people who had entered into the covenant that everyone would set free his slave, male or female, so that they would not be enslaved again. They obeyed and set them free. But afterward they turned around and took back the male and female slaves they had set free, and brought them into subjection as slaves. The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD: “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I myself made a covenant with your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, saying, ‘At the end of seven years each of you must set free the fellow Hebrew who has been sold to you and has served you six years; you must set him free from your service.’ But your fathers did not listen to me or incline their ears to me. You recently repented and did what was right in my eyes by proclaiming liberty, each to his neighbor, and you made a covenant before me in the house that is called by my name, but then you turned around and profaned my name when each of you took back his male and female slaves, whom you had set free according to their desire, and you brought them into subjection to be your slaves.\n“Therefore, thus says the LORD: You have not obeyed me by proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother and to his neighbor; behold, I proclaim to you liberty to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine, declares the LORD. I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth. And the men who transgressed my covenant and did not keep the terms of the covenant that they made before me, I will make them like the calf that they cut in two and passed between its parts— the officials of Judah, the officials of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf. And I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives. Their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth. And Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials I will give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives, into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon which has withdrawn from you. Behold, I will command, declares the LORD, and will bring them back to this city. And they will fight against it and take it and burn it with fire. I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant.”",

I brought them to the house of the LORD into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was near the chamber of the officials, above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, keeper of the threshold. Then I set before the Rechabites pitchers full of wine, and cups, and I said to them, “Drink wine.” But they answered, “We will drink no wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, ‘You shall not drink wine, neither you nor your sons forever. You shall not build a house; you shall not sow seed; you shall not plant or have a vineyard; but you shall live in tents all your days, that you may live many days in the land where you sojourn.’ We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, ourselves, our wives, our sons, or our daughters, and not to build houses to dwell in. We have no vineyard or field or seed, but we have lived in tents and have obeyed and done all that Jonadab our father commanded us. But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, we said, ‘Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and the army of the Syrians.’ So we are living in Jerusalem.”\nThen the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will you not receive instruction and listen to my words? declares the LORD. The command that Jonadab the son of Rechab gave to his sons, to drink no wine, has been kept, and they drink none to this day, for they have obeyed their father’s command. I have spoken to you persistently, but you have not listened to me. I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, sending them persistently, saying, ‘Turn now every one of you from his evil way, and amend your deeds, and do not go after other gods to serve them, and then you shall dwell in the land that I gave to you and your fathers.’ But you did not incline your ear or listen to me. The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have kept the command that their father gave them, but this people has not obeyed me. Therefore, thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing upon Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the disaster that I have pronounced against them, because I have spoken to them and they have not listened, I have called to them and they have not answered.”\nBut to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said, “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your father and kept all his precepts and done all that he commanded you, therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab the son of Rechab shall never lack a man to stand before me.”",

      "chapter_text": "In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD: “Take a scroll and write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel and Judah and all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah until today. It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the disaster that I intend to do to them, so that every one may turn from his evil way, and that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.”\nThen Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote on a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD that he had spoken to him. And Jeremiah ordered Baruch, saying, “I am banned from going to the house of the LORD, so you are to go, and on a day of fasting in the hearing of all the people in the LORD’s house you shall read the words of the LORD from the scroll that you have written at my dictation. You shall read them also in the hearing of all the men of Judah who come out of their cities. It may be that their plea for mercy will come before the LORD, and that every one will turn from his evil way, for great is the anger and wrath that the LORD has pronounced against this people.” And Baruch the son of Neriah did all that Jeremiah the prophet ordered him about reading from the scroll the words of the LORD in the LORD’s house.\nIn the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the LORD. Then, in the hearing of all the people, Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the scroll, in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper court, at the entry of the New Gate of the LORD’s house.\nWhen Micaiah the son of Gemariah, son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the scroll, he went down to the king’s house, into the secretary’s chamber, and all the officials were sitting there: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the officials. And Micaiah told them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the scroll in the hearing of the people. Then all the officials sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, “Take in your hand the scroll that you read in the hearing of the people, and come.” So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them. And they said to him, “Sit down and read it.” So Baruch read it to them. When they heard all the words, they turned one to another in fear. And they said to Baruch, “We must report all these words to the king.” Then they asked Baruch, “Tell us, please, how did you write all these words? Was it at his dictation?” Baruch answered them, “He dictated all these words to me, while I wrote them with ink on the scroll.” Then the officials said to Baruch, “Go and hide, you and Jeremiah, and let no one know where you are.”\nSo they went into the court to the king, having put the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the secretary, and they reported all the words to the king. Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the secretary. And Jehudi read it to the king and all the officials who stood beside the king. It was the ninth month, and the king was sitting in the winter house, and there was a fire burning in the fire pot before him. As Jehudi read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a knife and throw them into the fire in the fire pot, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the fire pot. Yet neither the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words was afraid, nor did they tear their garments. Even when Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them. And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son and Seraiah the son of Azriel and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet, but the LORD hid them.\nNow after the king had burned the scroll with the words that Baruch wrote at Jeremiah’s dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah: “Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned. And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, ‘Thus says the LORD, You have burned this scroll, saying, “Why have you written in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cut off from it man and beast?” Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit on the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day and the frost by night. And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity.

But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the words of the LORD that he spoke through Jeremiah the prophet.\nKing Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the priest, the son of Maaseiah, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “Please pray for us to the LORD our God.” Now Jeremiah was still going in and out among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison. The army of Pharaoh had come out of Egypt. And when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.\nThen the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet: “Thus says the LORD, God of Israel: Thus shall you say to the king of Judah who sent you to me to inquire of me, ‘Behold, Pharaoh’s army that came to help you is about to return to Egypt, to its own land. And the Chaldeans shall come back and fight against this city. They shall capture it and burn it with fire. Thus says the LORD, Do not deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans will surely go away from us,” for they will not go away. For even if you should defeat the whole army of Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and there remained of them only wounded men, every man in his tent, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.’”\n\nNow when the Chaldean army had withdrawn from Jerusalem at the approach of Pharaoh’s army, Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to receive his portion there among the people. When he was at the Benjamin Gate, a sentry there named Irijah the son of Shelemiah, son of Hananiah, seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are deserting to the Chaldeans.” And Jeremiah said, “It is a lie; I am not deserting to the Chaldeans.” But Irijah would not listen to him, and seized Jeremiah and brought him to the officials. And the officials were enraged at Jeremiah, and they beat him and imprisoned him in the house of Jonathan the secretary, for it had been made a prison.\nWhen Jeremiah had come to the dungeon cells and remained there many days, King Zedekiah sent for him and received him. The king questioned him secretly in his house and said, “Is there any word from the LORD?” Jeremiah said, “There is.” Then he said, “You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.” Jeremiah also said to King Zedekiah, “What wrong have I done to you or your servants or this people, that you have put me in prison? Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land’? Now hear, please, O my lord the king: let my humble plea come before you and do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, lest I die there.” So King Zedekiah gave orders, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guard. And a loaf of bread was given him daily from the bakers’ street, until all the bread of the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.",

      "chapter_text": "Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah was saying to all the people: “Thus says the LORD: He who stays in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, but he who goes out to the Chaldeans shall live. He shall have his life as a prize of war, and live. Thus says the LORD: This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon and be taken.” Then the officials said to the king, “Let this man be put to death, for he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm.” King Zedekiah said, “Behold, he is in your hands, for the king can do nothing against you.” So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king’s son, which was in the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down by ropes. And there was no water in the cistern, but only mud, and Jeremiah sank in the mud.\n\nWhen Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern—the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate— Ebed-melech went from the king’s house and said to the king, “My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they did to Jeremiah the prophet by casting him into the cistern, and he will die there of hunger, for there is no bread left in the city.” Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, “Take thirty men with you from here, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.” So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to the house of the king, to a wardrobe in the storehouse, and took from there old rags and worn-out clothes, which he let down to Jeremiah in the cistern by ropes. Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Put the rags and clothes between your armpits and the ropes.” Jeremiah did so. Then they drew Jeremiah up with ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.\n\nKing Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third entrance of the temple of the LORD. The king said to Jeremiah, “I will ask you a question; hide nothing from me.” Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, will you not surely put me to death? And if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.” Then King Zedekiah swore secretly to Jeremiah, “As the LORD lives, who made our souls, I will not put you to death or deliver you into the hand of these men who seek your life.”\nThen Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If you will surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then your life shall be spared, and this city shall not be burned with fire, and you and your house shall live. But if you do not surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape from their hand.” King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest I be handed over to them and they deal cruelly with me.” Jeremiah said, “You shall not be given to them. Obey now the voice of the LORD in what I say to you, and it shall be well with you, and your life shall be spared. But if you refuse to surrender, this is the vision which the LORD has shown to me: Behold, all the women left in the house of the king of Judah were being led out to the officials of the king of Babylon and were saying,\n\n“‘Your trusted friends have deceived you\nand prevailed against you;\nnow that your feet are sunk in the mud,\nthey turn away from you.’\n\nAll your wives and your sons shall be led out to the Chaldeans, and you yourself shall not escape from their hand, but shall be seized by the king of Babylon, and this city shall be burned with fire.”\nThen Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no one know of these words, and you shall not die. If the officials hear that I have spoken with you and come to you and say to you, ‘Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; hide nothing from us and we will not put you to death,’ then you shall say to them, ‘I made a humble plea to the king that he would not send me back to the house of Jonathan to die there.’” Then all the officials came to Jeremiah and asked him, and he answered them as the king had instructed him. So they stopped speaking with him, for the conversation had not been overheard. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.",

In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city. Then all the officials of the king of Babylon came and sat in the middle gate: Nergal-sar-ezer of Samgar, Nebu-sar-sekim the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, with all the rest of the officers of the king of Babylon. When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled, going out of the city at night by way of the king’s garden through the gate between the two walls; and they went toward the Arabah. But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, at Riblah, in the land of Hamath; and he passed sentence on him. The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah before his eyes, and the king of Babylon slaughtered all the nobles of Judah. He put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him in chains to take him to Babylon. The Chaldeans burned the king’s house and the house of the people, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried into exile to Babylon the rest of the people who were left in the city, those who had deserted to him, and the people who remained. Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, left in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.\nLORD\nNebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave command concerning Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, saying, “Take him, look after him well, and do him no harm, but deal with him as he tells you.” So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, Nebushazban the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon sent and took Jeremiah from the court of the guard. They entrusted him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, that he should take him home. So he lived among the people.\nThe word of the LORD came to Jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the guard: “Go, and say to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will fulfill my words against this city for harm and not for good, and they shall be accomplished before you on that day. But I will deliver you on that day, declares the LORD, and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid. For I will surely save you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but you shall have your life as a prize of war, because you have put your trust in me, declares the LORD.’”",

The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, “The LORD your God pronounced this disaster against this place. The LORD has brought it about, and has done as he said. Because you sinned against the LORD and did not obey his voice, this thing has come upon you. Now, behold, I release you today from the chains on your hands. If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you well, but if it seems wrong to you to come with me to Babylon, do not come. See, the whole land is before you; go wherever you think it good and right to go. If you remain, then return to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon appointed governor of the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people. Or go wherever you think it right to go.” So the captain of the guard gave him an allowance of food and a present, and let him go. Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah, and lived with him among the people who were left in the land.\nWhen all the captains of the forces in the open country and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land and had committed to him men, women, and children, those of the poorest of the land who had not been taken into exile to Babylon, they went to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan the son of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men. Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, swore to them and their men, saying, “Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. As for me, I will dwell at Mizpah, to represent you before the Chaldeans who will come to us. But as for you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and store them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.” Likewise, when all the Judeans who were in Moab and among the Ammonites and in Edom and in other lands heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, as governor over them, then all the Judeans returned from all the places to which they had been driven and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah. And they gathered wine and summer fruits in great abundance.\nNow Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah and said to him, “Do you know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam would not believe them. Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah at Mizpah, “Please let me go and strike down Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life, so that all the Judeans who are gathered about you would be scattered, and the remnant of Judah would perish?” But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You shall not do this thing, for you are speaking falsely of Ishmael.”",

      "chapter_text": "In the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the royal family, one of the chief officers of the king, came with ten men to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah. As they ate bread together there at Mizpah, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men with him rose up and struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with the sword, and killed him, whom the king of Babylon had appointed governor in the land. Ishmael also struck down all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldean soldiers who happened to be there.\nOn the day after the murder of Gedaliah, before anyone knew of it, eighty men arrived from Shechem and Shiloh and Samaria, with their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and their bodies gashed, bringing grain offerings and incense to present at the temple of the LORD. And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah came out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he came. As he met them, he said to them, “Come in to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.” When they came into the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men with him slaughtered them and cast them into a cistern. But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, “Do not put us to death, for we have stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey hidden in the fields.” So he refrained and did not put them to death with their companions.\nNow the cistern into which Ishmael had thrown all the bodies of the men whom he had struck down along with Gedaliah was the large cistern that King Asa had made for defense against Baasha king of Israel; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain. Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, the king’s daughters and all the people who were left at Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the Ammonites.\nBut when Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done, they took all their men and went to fight against Ishmael the son of Nethaniah. They came upon him at the great pool that is in Gibeon. And when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him, they rejoiced. So all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah. But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites. Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him took from Mizpah all the rest of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after he had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam—soldiers, women, children, and eunuchs, whom Johanan brought back from Gibeon. And they went and stayed at Geruth Chimham near Bethlehem, intending to go to Egypt because of the Chaldeans.

Behold, I will pray to the LORD your God according to your request, and whatever the LORD answers you I will tell you. I will keep nothing back from you.” Then they said to Jeremiah, “May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act according to all the word with which the LORD your God sends you to us. Whether it is good or bad, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God to whom we are sending you, that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.”\nAt the end of ten days the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah. Then he summoned Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest, and said to them, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your plea for mercy before him: If you will remain in this land, then I will build you up and not pull you down; I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I relent of the disaster that I did to you. Do not fear the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid. Do not fear him, declares the LORD, for I am with you, to save you and to deliver you from his hand. I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you and let you remain in your own land. But if you say, ‘We will not remain in this land,’ disobeying the voice of the LORD your God and saying, ‘No, we will go to the land of Egypt, where we shall not see war or hear the sound of the trumpet or be hungry for bread, and we will dwell there,’ then hear the word of the LORD, O remnant of Judah. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: If you set your faces to enter Egypt and go to live there, then the sword that you fear shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine of which you are afraid shall follow close after you to Egypt, and there you shall die. All the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to live there shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. They shall have no remnant or survivor from the disaster that I will bring upon them.\n“For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: As my anger and my wrath were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will be poured out on you when you go to Egypt. You shall become an execration, a horror, a curse, and a taunt. You shall see this place no more. The LORD has said to you, O remnant of Judah, ‘Do not go to Egypt.’ Know for a certainty that I have warned you this day that you have gone astray at the cost of your lives. For you sent me to the LORD your God, saying, ‘Pray for us to the LORD our God, and whatever the LORD our God says, declare to us and we will do it.’ And I have this day declared it to you, but you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God in anything that he sent me to tell you. Now therefore know for a certainty that you shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence in the place where you desire to go to live.”",

The LORD our God did not send you to say, ‘Do not go to Egypt to live there,’ but Baruch the son of Neriah has set you against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may kill us or take us into exile in Babylon.” So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces and all the people did not obey the voice of the LORD, to remain in the land of Judah. But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took all the remnant of Judah who had returned to live in the land of Judah from all the nations to which they had been driven— the men, the women, the children, the princesses, and every person whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan; also Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah. And they came into the land of Egypt, for they did not obey the voice of the LORD. And they arrived at Tahpanhes.\nThen the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes: “Take in your hands large stones and hide them in the mortar in the pavement that is at the entrance to Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah, and say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and I will set his throne above these stones that I have hidden, and he will spread his royal canopy over them. He shall come and strike the land of Egypt, giving over to the pestilence those who are doomed to the pestilence, to captivity those who are doomed to captivity, and to the sword those who are doomed to the sword. I shall kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Egypt, and he shall burn them and carry them away captive. And he shall clean the land of Egypt as a shepherd cleans his cloak of vermin, and he shall go away from there in peace. He shall break the obelisks of Heliopolis, which is in the land of Egypt, and the temples of the gods of Egypt he shall burn with fire.’”",

      "chapter_text": "The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Judeans who lived in the land of Egypt, at Migdol, at Tahpanhes, at Memphis, and in the land of Pathros, “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: You have seen all the disaster that I brought upon Jerusalem and upon all the cities of Judah. Behold, this day they are a desolation, and no one dwells in them, because of the evil that they committed, provoking me to anger, in that they went to make offerings and serve other gods that they knew not, neither they, nor you, nor your fathers. Yet I persistently sent to you all my servants the prophets, saying, ‘Oh, do not do this abomination that I hate!’ But they did not listen or incline their ear, to turn from their evil and make no offerings to other gods. Therefore my wrath and my anger were poured out and kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, and they became a waste and a desolation, as at this day. And now thus says the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel: Why do you commit this great evil against yourselves, to cut off from you man and woman, infant and child, from the midst of Judah, leaving you no remnant? Why do you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands, making offerings to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have come to live, so that you may be cut off and become a curse and a taunt among all the nations of the earth? Have you forgotten the evil of your fathers, the evil of the kings of Judah, the evil of their wives, your own evil, and the evil of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? They have not humbled themselves even to this day, nor have they feared, nor walked in my law and my statutes that I set before you and before your fathers.\n“Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will set my face against you for harm, to cut off all Judah. I will take the remnant of Judah who have set their faces to come to the land of Egypt to live, and they shall all be consumed. In the land of Egypt they shall fall; by the sword and by famine they shall be consumed. From the least to the greatest, they shall die by the sword and by famine, and they shall become an oath, a horror, a curse, and a taunt. I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, so that none of the remnant of Judah who have come to live in the land of Egypt shall escape or survive or return to the land of Judah, to which they desire to return to dwell there. For they shall not return, except some fugitives.”\nThen all the men who knew that their wives had made offerings to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great assembly, all the people who lived in Pathros in the land of Egypt, answered Jeremiah: “As for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we will not listen to you. But we will do everything that we have vowed, make offerings to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her, as we did, both we and our fathers, our kings and our officials, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. For then we had plenty of food, and prospered, and saw no disaster. But since we left off making offerings to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed by the sword and by famine.” And the women said, “When we made offerings to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, was it without our husbands’ approval that we made cakes for her bearing her image and poured out drink offerings to her?”\nThen Jeremiah said to all the people, men and women, all the people who had given him this answer: “As for the offerings that you offered in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your officials, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them? Did it not come into his mind? The LORD could no longer bear your evil deeds and the abominations that you committed. Therefore your land has become a desolation and a waste and a curse, without inhabitant, as it is this day. It is because you made offerings and because you sinned against the LORD and did not obey the voice of the LORD or walk in his law and in his statutes and in his testimonies that this disaster has happened to you, as at this day.”\nJeremiah said to all the people and all the women, “Hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah who are in the land of Egypt. Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: You and your wives have declared with your mouths, and have fulfilled it with your hands, saying, ‘We will surely perform our vows that we have made, to make offerings to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings to her.’ Then confirm your vows and perform your vows! Therefore hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great name, says the LORD, that my name shall no more be invoked by the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, ‘As the Lord GOD lives.’ Behold, I am watching over them for disaster and not for good. All the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by famine, until there is an end of them. And those who escape the sword shall return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah, few in number; and all the remnant of Judah, who came to the land of Egypt to live, shall know whose word will stand, mine or theirs.

A cry from Horonaim,\n‘Desolation and great destruction!’\nMoab is destroyed;\nher little ones have made a cry.\nFor at the ascent of Luhith\nthey go up weeping;\nfor at the descent of Horonaim\nthey have heard the distressed cry of destruction.\nFlee! Save yourselves!\nYou will be like a juniper in the desert!\nFor, because you trusted in your works and your treasures,\nyou also shall be taken;\nand Chemosh shall go into exile\nwith his priests and his officials.\nThe destroyer shall come upon every city,\nand no city shall escape;\nthe valley shall perish,\nand the plain shall be destroyed,\nas the LORD has spoken.\n\n“Give wings to Moab,\nfor she would fly away;\nher cities shall become a desolation,\nwith no inhabitant in them.\n\n“Cursed is he who does the work of the LORD with slackness, and cursed is he who keeps back his sword from bloodshed.\n\n“Moab has been at ease from his youth\nand has settled on his dregs;\nhe has not been emptied from vessel to vessel,\nnor has he gone into exile;\nso his taste remains in him,\nand his scent is not changed.\n\n“Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I shall send to him pourers who will pour him, and empty his vessels and break his jars in pieces. Then Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence.\n\n“How do you say, ‘We are heroes\nand mighty men of war’?\nThe destroyer of Moab and his cities has come up,\nand the choicest of his young men have gone down to slaughter,\ndeclares the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.\nThe calamity of Moab is near at hand,\nand his affliction hastens swiftly.\nGrieve for him, all you who are around him,\nand all who know his name;\nsay, ‘How the mighty scepter is broken,\nthe glorious staff.’\n\n“Come down from your glory,\nand sit on the parched ground,\nO inhabitant of Dibon!\nFor the destroyer of Moab has come up against you;\nhe has destroyed your strongholds.\nStand by the way and watch,\nO inhabitant of Aroer!\nAsk him who flees and her who escapes;\nsay, ‘What has happened?’\nMoab is put to shame, for it is broken;\nwail and cry!\nTell it beside the Arnon,\nthat Moab is laid waste.\n\n“Judgment has come upon the tableland, upon Holon, and Jahzah, and Mephaath, and Dibon, and Nebo, and Beth-diblathaim, and Kiriathaim, and Beth-gamul, and Beth-meon, and Kerioth, and Bozrah, and all the cities of the land of Moab, far and near. The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, declares the LORD.\n“Make him drunk, because he magnified himself against the LORD, so that Moab shall wallow in his vomit, and he too shall be held in derision. Was not Israel a derision to you? Was he found among thieves, that whenever you spoke of him you wagged your head?\n\n“Leave the cities, and dwell in the rock,\nO inhabitants of Moab!\nBe like the dove that nests\nin the sides of the mouth of a gorge.\nWe have heard of the pride of Moab—\nhe is very proud—\nof his loftiness, his pride, and his arrogance,\nand the haughtiness of his heart.\nI know his insolence, declares the LORD;\nhis boasts are false,\nhis deeds are false.\nTherefore I wail for Moab;\nI cry out for all Moab;\nfor the men of Kir-hareseth I mourn.\nMore than for Jazer I weep for you,\nO vine of Sibmah!\nYour branches passed over the sea,\nreached to the Sea of Jazer;\non your summer fruits and your grapes\nthe destroyer has fallen.\nGladness and joy have been taken away\nfrom the fruitful land of Moab;\nI have made the wine cease from the winepresses;\nno one treads them with shouts of joy;\nthe shouting is not the shout of joy.\n\n“From the outcry at Heshbon even to Elealeh, as far as Jahaz they utter their voice, from Zoar to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah. For the waters of Nimrim also have become desolate. And I will bring to an end in Moab, declares the LORD, him who offers sacrifice in the high place and makes offerings to his god. Therefore my heart moans for Moab like a flute, and my heart moans like a flute for the men of Kir-hareseth. Therefore the riches they gained have perished.\n“For every head is shaved and every beard cut off. On all the hands are gashes, and around the waist is sackcloth. On all the housetops of Moab and in the squares there is nothing but lamentation, for I have broken Moab like a vessel for which no one cares, declares the LORD. How it is broken! How they wail! How Moab has turned his back in shame! So Moab has become a derision and a horror to all that are around him.”\n\nFor thus says the LORD:\n“Behold, one shall fly swiftly like an eagle\nand spread his wings against Moab;\nthe cities shall be taken\nand the strongholds seized.\nThe heart of the warriors of Moab shall be in that day\nlike the heart of a woman in her birth pains;\nMoab shall be destroyed and be no longer a people,\nbecause he magnified himself against the LORD.\nTerror, pit, and snare\nare before you, O inhabitant of Moab!\ndeclares the LORD.\nHe who flees from the terror\nshall fall into the pit,\nand he who climbs out of the pit\nshall be caught in the snare.\nFor I will bring these things upon Moab,\nthe year of their punishment,\ndeclares the LORD.\n\n“In the shadow of Heshbon\nfugitives stop without strength,\nfor fire came out from Heshbon,\nflame from the house of Sihon;\nit has destroyed the forehead of Moab,\nthe crown of the sons of tumult.\nWoe to you, O Moab!\nThe people of Chemosh are undone,\nfor your sons have been taken captive,\nand your daughters into captivity.\nYet I will restore the fortunes of Moab\nin the latter days, declares the LORD.”\nThus far is the judgment on Moab.",

You shall not go unpunished, but you must drink. For I have sworn by myself, declares the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a horror, a taunt, a waste, and a curse, and all her cities shall be perpetual wastes.”\n\nI have heard a message from the LORD,\nand an envoy has been sent among the nations:\n“Gather yourselves together and come against her,\nand rise up for battle!\nFor behold, I will make you small among the nations,\ndespised among mankind.\nThe horror you inspire has deceived you,\nand the pride of your heart,\nyou who live in the clefts of the rock,\nwho hold the height of the hill.\nThough you make your nest as high as the eagle’s,\nI will bring you down from there,\ndeclares the LORD.\n\n“Edom shall become a horror. Everyone who passes by it will be horrified and will hiss because of all its disasters. As when Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring cities were overthrown, says the LORD, no man shall dwell there, no man shall sojourn in her. Behold, like a lion coming up from the jungle of the Jordan against a perennial pasture, I will suddenly make him run away from her. And I will appoint over her whomever I choose. For who is like me? Who will summon me? What shepherd can stand before me? Therefore hear the plan that the LORD has made against Edom and the purposes that he has formed against the inhabitants of Teman: Even the little ones of the flock shall be dragged away. Surely their fold shall be appalled at their fate. At the sound of their fall the earth shall tremble; the sound of their cry shall be heard at the Red Sea. Behold, one shall mount up and fly swiftly like an eagle and spread his wings against Bozrah, and the heart of the warriors of Edom shall be in that day like the heart of a woman in her birth pains.”\n\nConcerning Damascus:\n\n“Hamath and Arpad are confounded,\nfor they have heard bad news;\nthey melt in fear,\nthey are troubled like the sea that cannot be quiet.\nDamascus has become feeble, she turned to flee,\nand panic seized her;\nanguish and sorrows have taken hold of her,\nas of a woman in labor.\nHow is the famous city not forsaken,\nthe city of my joy?\nTherefore her young men shall fall in her squares,\nand all her soldiers shall be destroyed in that day,\ndeclares the LORD of hosts.\nAnd I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus,\nand it shall devour the strongholds of Ben-hadad.”\n\nConcerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck down.\n\nThus says the LORD:\n“Rise up, advance against Kedar!\nDestroy the people of the east!\nTheir tents and their flocks shall be taken,\ntheir curtains and all their goods;\ntheir camels shall be led away from them,\nand men shall cry to them: ‘Terror on every side!’\nFlee, wander far away, dwell in the depths,\nO inhabitants of Hazor!\ndeclares the LORD.\nFor Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon\nhas made a plan against you\nand formed a purpose against you.\n\n“Rise up, advance against a nation at ease,\nthat dwells securely,\ndeclares the LORD,\nthat has no gates or bars,\nthat dwells alone.\nTheir camels shall become plunder,\ntheir herds of livestock a spoil.\nI will scatter to every wind\nthose who cut the corners of their hair,\nand I will bring their calamity\nfrom every side of them,\ndeclares the LORD.\nHazor shall become a haunt of jackals,\nan everlasting waste;\nno man shall dwell there;\nno man shall sojourn in her.”\n\nThe word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah.\nThus says the LORD of hosts: “Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the mainstay of their might. And I will bring upon Elam the four winds from the four quarters of heaven. And I will scatter them to all those winds, and there shall be no nation to which those driven out of Elam shall not come. I will terrify Elam before their enemies and before those who seek their life. I will bring disaster upon them, my fierce anger, declares the LORD. I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them, and I will set my throne in Elam and destroy their king and officials, declares the LORD.\n“But in the latter days I will restore the fortunes of Elam, declares the LORD.”",

They shall ask the way to Zion, with faces turned toward it, saying, ‘Come, let us join ourselves to the LORD in an everlasting covenant that will never be forgotten.’\n“My people have been lost sheep. Their shepherds have led them astray, turning them away on the mountains. From mountain to hill they have gone. They have forgotten their fold. All who found them have devoured them, and their enemies have said, ‘We are not guilty, for they have sinned against the LORD, their habitation of righteousness, the LORD, the hope of their fathers.’\n“Flee from the midst of Babylon, and go out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as male goats before the flock. For behold, I am stirring up and bringing against Babylon a gathering of great nations, from the north country. And they shall array themselves against her. From there she shall be taken. Their arrows are like a skilled warrior who does not return empty-handed. Chaldea shall be plundered; all who plunder her shall be sated, declares the LORD.\n\n“Though you rejoice, though you exult,\nO plunderers of my heritage,\nthough you frolic like a heifer in the pasture,\nand neigh like stallions,\nyour mother shall be utterly shamed,\nand she who bore you shall be disgraced.\nBehold, she shall be the last of the nations,\na wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.\nBecause of the wrath of the LORD she shall not be inhabited\nbut shall be an utter desolation;\neveryone who passes by Babylon shall be appalled,\nand hiss because of all her wounds.\nSet yourselves in array against Babylon all around,\nall you who bend the bow;\nshoot at her, spare no arrows,\nfor she has sinned against the LORD.\nRaise a shout against her all around;\nshe has surrendered;\nher bulwarks have fallen;\nher walls are thrown down.\nFor this is the vengeance of the LORD:\ntake vengeance on her;\ndo to her as she has done.\nCut off from Babylon the sower,\nand the one who handles the sickle in time of harvest;\nbecause of the sword of the oppressor,\nevery one shall turn to his own people,\nand every one shall flee to his own land.\n\n“Israel is a hunted sheep driven away by lions. First the king of Assyria devoured him, and now at last Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has gnawed his bones. Therefore, thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing punishment on the king of Babylon and his land, as I punished the king of Assyria. I will restore Israel to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and in Bashan, and his desire shall be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead. In those days and in that time, declares the LORD, iniquity shall be sought in Israel, and there shall be none, and sin in Judah, and none shall be found, for I will pardon those whom I leave as a remnant.\n\n“Go up against the land of Merathaim,\nand against the inhabitants of Pekod.\nKill, and devote them to destruction,\ndeclares the LORD,\nand do all that I have commanded you.\nThe noise of battle is in the land,\nand great destruction!\nHow the hammer of the whole earth\nis cut down and broken!\nHow Babylon has become\na horror among the nations!\nI set a snare for you and you were taken, O Babylon,\nand you did not know it;\nyou were found and caught,\nbecause you opposed the LORD.\nThe LORD has opened his armory\nand brought out the weapons of his wrath,\nfor the Lord GOD of hosts has a work to do\nin the land of the Chaldeans.\nCome against her from every quarter;\nopen her granaries;\npile her up like heaps of grain, and devote her to destruction;\nlet nothing be left of her.\nKill all her bulls;\nlet them go down to the slaughter.\nWoe to them, for their day has come,\nthe time of their punishment.\n\n“A voice! They flee and escape from the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, vengeance for his temple.\n“Summon archers against Babylon, all those who bend the bow. Encamp around her; let no one escape. Repay her according to her deeds; do to her according to all that she has done. For she has proudly defied the LORD, the Holy One of Israel. Therefore her young men shall fall in her squares, and all her soldiers shall be destroyed on that day, declares the LORD.\n\n“Behold, I am against you, O proud one,\ndeclares the Lord GOD of hosts,\nfor your day has come,\nthe time when I will punish you.\nThe proud one shall stumble and fall,\nwith none to raise him up,\nand I will kindle a fire in his cities,\nand it will devour all that is around him.\n\n“Thus says the LORD of hosts: The people of Israel are oppressed, and the people of Judah with them. All who took them captive have held them fast; they refuse to let them go. Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name. He will surely plead their cause, that he may give rest to the earth, but unrest to the inhabitants of Babylon.\n\n“A sword against the Chaldeans, declares the LORD,\nand against the inhabitants of Babylon,\nand against her officials and her wise men!\nA sword against the diviners,\nthat they may become fools!\nA sword against her warriors,\nthat they may be destroyed!\nA sword against her horses and against her chariots,\nand against all the foreign troops in her midst,\nthat they may become women!\nA sword against all her treasures,\nthat they may be plundered!\nA drought against her waters,\nthat they may be dried up!\nFor it is a land of images,\nand they are mad over idols.\n\n“Therefore wild beasts shall dwell with hyenas in Babylon, and ostriches shall dwell in her. She shall never again have people, nor be inhabited for all generations. As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring cities, declares the LORD, so no man shall dwell there, and no son of man shall sojourn in her.\n\n“Behold, a people comes from the north;\na mighty nation and many kings\nare stirring from the farthest parts of the earth.\nThey lay hold of bow and spear;\nthey are cruel and have no mercy.\nThe sound of them is like the roaring of the sea;\nthey ride on horses,\narrayed as a man for battle\nagainst you, O daughter of Babylon!\n\n“The king of Babylon heard the report of them,\nand his hands fell helpless;\nanguish seized him,\npain as of a woman in labor.\n\n“Behold, like a lion coming up from the thicket of the Jordan against a perennial pasture, I will suddenly make them run away from her, and I will appoint over her whomever I choose. For who is like me? Who will summon me? What shepherd can stand before me? Therefore hear the plan that the LORD has made against Babylon, and the purposes that he has formed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the little ones of their flock shall be dragged away; surely their fold shall be appalled at their fate. At the sound of the capture of Babylon the earth shall tremble, and her cry shall be heard among the nations.”",

shall winnow her,\nand they shall empty her land,\nwhen they come against her from every side\non the day of trouble.\nLet not the archer bend his bow,\nand let him not stand up in his armor.\nSpare not her young men;\ndevote to destruction all her army.\nThey shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans,\nand wounded in her streets.\nFor Israel and Judah have not been forsaken\nby their God, the LORD of hosts,\nbut the land of the Chaldeans is full of guilt\nagainst the Holy One of Israel.\n\n“Flee from the midst of Babylon;\nlet every one save his life!\nBe not cut off in her punishment,\nfor this is the time of the LORD’s vengeance,\nthe repayment he is rendering her.\nBabylon was a golden cup in the LORD’s hand,\nmaking all the earth drunken;\nthe nations drank of her wine;\ntherefore the nations went mad.\nSuddenly Babylon has fallen and been broken;\nwail for her!\nTake balm for her pain;\nperhaps she may be healed.\nWe would have healed Babylon,\nbut she was not healed.\nForsake her, and let us go\neach to his own country,\nfor her judgment has reached up to heaven\nand has been lifted up even to the skies.\nThe LORD has brought about our vindication;\ncome, let us declare in Zion\nthe work of the LORD our God.\n\n“Sharpen the arrows!\nTake up the shields!\n\nThe LORD has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes, because his purpose concerning Babylon is to destroy it, for that is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance for his temple.\n\n“Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon;\nmake the watch strong;\nset up watchmen;\nprepare the ambushes;\nfor the LORD has both planned and done\nwhat he spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.\nO you who dwell by many waters,\nrich in treasures,\nyour end has come;\nthe thread of your life is cut.\nThe LORD of hosts has sworn by himself:\nSurely I will fill you with men, as many as locusts,\nand they shall raise the shout of victory over you.\n\n“It is he who made the earth by his power,\nwho established the world by his wisdom,\nand by his understanding stretched out the heavens.\nWhen he utters his voice there is a tumult of waters in the heavens,\nand he makes the mist rise from the ends of the earth.\nHe makes lightning for the rain,\nand he brings forth the wind from his storehouses.\nEvery man is stupid and without knowledge;\nevery goldsmith is put to shame by his idols,\nfor his images are false,\nand there is no breath in them.\nThey are worthless, a work of delusion;\nat the time of their punishment they shall perish.\nNot like these is he who is the portion of Jacob,\nfor he is the one who formed all things,\nand Israel is the tribe of his inheritance;\nthe LORD of hosts is his name.\n\n“You are my hammer and weapon of war:\nwith you I break nations in pieces;\nwith you I destroy kingdoms;\nwith you I break in pieces the horse and his rider;\nwith you I break in pieces the chariot and the charioteer;\nwith you I break in pieces man and woman;\nwith you I break in pieces the old man and the youth;\nwith you I break in pieces the young man and the young woman;\nwith you I break in pieces the shepherd and his flock;\nwith you I break in pieces the farmer and his team;\nwith you I break in pieces governors and commanders.\n\n“I will repay Babylon and all the inhabitants of Chaldea before your very eyes for all the evil that they have done in Zion, declares the LORD.\n\n“Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain,\ndeclares the LORD,\nwhich destroys the whole earth;\nI will stretch out my hand against you,\nand roll you down from the crags,\nand make you a burnt mountain.\nNo stone shall be taken from you for a corner\nand no stone for a foundation,\nbut you shall be a perpetual waste,\ndeclares the LORD.\n\n“Set up a standard on the earth;\nblow the trumpet among the nations;\nprepare the nations for war against her;\nsummon against her the kingdoms,\nArarat, Minni, and Ashkenaz;\nappoint a marshal against her;\nbring up horses like bristling locusts.\nPrepare the nations for war against her,\nthe kings of the Medes, with their governors and deputies,\nand every land under their dominion.\nThe land trembles and writhes in pain,\nfor the LORD’s purposes against Babylon stand,\nto make the land of Babylon a desolation,\nwithout inhabitant.\nThe warriors of Babylon have ceased fighting;\nthey remain in their strongholds;\ntheir strength has failed;\nthey have become women;\nher dwellings are on fire;\nher bars are broken.\nOne runner runs to meet another,\nand one messenger to meet another,\nto tell the king of Babylon\nthat his city is taken on every side;\nthe fords have been seized,\nthe marshes are burned with fire,\nand the soldiers are in panic.\nFor thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel:\nThe daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor\nat the time when it is trodden;\nyet a little while\nand the time of her harvest will come.”\n\n“Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me;\nhe has crushed me;\nhe has made me an empty vessel;\nhe has swallowed me like a monster;\nhe has filled his stomach with my delicacies;\nhe has rinsed me out.\nThe violence done to me and to my kinsmen be upon Babylon,”\nlet the inhabitant of Zion say.\n“My blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea,”\nlet Jerusalem say.\nTherefore thus says the LORD:\n“Behold, I will plead your cause\nand take vengeance for you.\nI will dry up her sea\nand make her fountain dry,\nand Babylon shall become a heap of ruins,\nthe haunt of jackals,\na horror and a hissing,\nwithout inhabitant.\n\n“They shall roar together like lions;\nthey shall growl like lions’ cubs.\nWhile they are inflamed I will prepare them a feast\nand make them drunk, that they may become merry,\nthen sleep a perpetual sleep\nand not wake, declares the LORD.\nI will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter,\nlike rams and male goats.\n\n“How Babylon is taken,\nthe praise of the whole earth seized!\nHow Babylon has become\na horror among the nations!\nThe sea has come up on Babylon;\nshe is covered with its tumultuous waves.\nHer cities have become a horror,\na land of drought and a desert,\na land in which no one dwells,\nand through which no son of man passes.\nAnd I will punish Bel in Babylon,\nand take out of his mouth what he has swallowed.\nThe nations shall no longer flow to him;\nthe wall of Babylon has fallen.\n\n“Go out of the midst of her, my people!\nLet every one save his life\nfrom the fierce anger of the LORD!\nLet not your heart faint, and be not fearful\nat the report heard in the land,\nwhen a report comes in one year\nand afterward a report in another year,\nand violence is in the land,\nand ruler is against ruler.\n\n“Therefore, behold, the days are coming\nwhen I will punish the images of Babylon;\nher whole land shall be put to shame,\nand all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.\nThen the heavens and the earth,\nand all that is in them,\nshall sing for joy over Babylon,\nfor the destroyers shall come against them out of the north,\ndeclares the LORD.\nBabylon must fall for the slain of Israel,\njust as for Babylon have fallen the slain of all the earth.\n\n“You who have escaped from the sword,\ngo, do not stand still!\nRemember the LORD from far away,\nand let Jerusalem come into your mind:\n‘We are put to shame, for we have heard reproach;\ndishonor has covered our face,\nfor foreigners have come\ninto the holy places of the LORD’s house.’\n\n“Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD,\nwhen I will execute judgment upon her images,\nand through all her land\nthe wounded shall groan.\nThough Babylon should mount up to heaven,\nand though she should fortify her strong height,\nyet destroyers would come from me against her,\ndeclares the LORD.\n\n“A voice! A cry from Babylon!\nThe noise of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!\nFor the LORD is laying Babylon waste\nand stilling her mighty voice.\nTheir waves roar like many waters;\nthe noise of their voice is raised,\nfor a destroyer has come upon her,\nupon Babylon;\nher warriors are taken;\ntheir bows are broken in pieces,\nfor the LORD is a God of recompense;\nhe will surely repay.\nI will make drunk her officials and her wise men,\nher governors, her commanders, and her warriors;\nthey shall sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake,\ndeclares the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.\n\n“Thus says the LORD of hosts:\nThe broad wall of Babylon\nshall be leveled to the ground,\nand her high gates\nshall be burned with fire.\nThe peoples labor for nothing,\nand the nations weary themselves only for fire.”\n\nThe word that Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah king of Judah to Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign. Seraiah was the quartermaster. Jeremiah wrote in a book all the disaster that should come upon Babylon, all these words that are written concerning Babylon. And Jeremiah said to Seraiah: “When you come to Babylon, see that you read all these words, and say, ‘O LORD, you have said concerning this place that you will cut it off, so that nothing shall dwell in it, neither man nor beast, and it shall be desolate forever.’ When you finish reading this book, tie a stone to it and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates, and say, ‘Thus shall Babylon sink, to rise no more, because of the disaster that I am bringing upon her, and they shall become exhausted.’”\nThus far are the words of Jeremiah.",

      "chapter_text": "Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. For because of the anger of the LORD it came to the point in Jerusalem and Judah that he cast them out from his presence.\nAnd Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. And in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem, and laid siege to it. And they built siegeworks all around it. So the city was besieged till the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land. Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled and went out from the city by night by the way of a gate between the two walls, by the king’s garden, and the Chaldeans were around the city. And they went in the direction of the Arabah. But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him. Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him. The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and also slaughtered all the officials of Judah at Riblah. He put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in chains, and the king of Babylon took him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.\n\nIn the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month—that was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon—Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, who served the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem. And he burned the house of the LORD, and the king’s house and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great house he burned down. And all the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls around Jerusalem. And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive some of the poorest of the people and the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, together with the rest of the artisans. But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.\nAnd the pillars of bronze that were in the house of the LORD, and the stands and the bronze sea that were in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried all the bronze to Babylon. And they took away the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the basins and the dishes for incense and all the vessels of bronze used in the temple service; also the small bowls and the fire pans and the basins and the pots and the lampstands and the dishes for incense and the bowls for drink offerings. What was of gold the captain of the guard took away as gold, and what was of silver, as silver. As for the two pillars, the one sea, the twelve bronze bulls that were under the sea, and the stands, which Solomon the king had made for the house of the LORD, the bronze of all these things was beyond weight. As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, its circumference was twelve cubits, and its thickness was four fingers, and it was hollow. On it was a capital of bronze. The height of the one capital was five cubits. A network and pomegranates, all of bronze, were around the capital. And the second pillar had the same, with pomegranates. There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were a hundred upon the network all around.\n\nAnd the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the threshold; and from the city he took an officer who had been in command of the men of war, and seven men of the king’s council, who were found in the city; and the secretary of the commander of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the midst of the city. And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. And the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was taken into exile out of its land.\nThis is the number of the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year, 3,023 Judeans; in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem 832 persons; in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Judeans 745 persons; all the persons were 4,600.\n\nAnd in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, graciously freed Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison. And he spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat above the seats of the kings who were with him in Babylon. So Jehoiachin put off his prison garments. And every day of his life he dined regularly at the king’s table, and for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king, according to his daily needs, until the day of his death, as long as he lived.",
