      "chapter_text": "The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah.\nIt came to pass in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the citadel, that Hanani one of my brethren came with men from Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who had survived the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. And they said to me, “The survivors who are left from the captivity in the province are there in great distress and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem is also broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.”\nSo it was, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned for many days; I was fasting and praying before the God of heaven.\nAnd I said: “I pray, LORD God of heaven, O great and awesome God, You who keep Your covenant and mercy with those who love You and observe Your commandments, please let Your ear be attentive and Your eyes open, that You may hear the prayer of Your servant which I pray before You now, day and night, for the children of Israel Your servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel which we have sinned against You. Both my father’s house and I have sinned. We have acted very corruptly against You, and have not kept the commandments, the statutes, nor the ordinances which You commanded Your servant Moses. Remember, I pray, the word that You commanded Your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations; but if you return to Me, and keep My commandments and do them, though some of you were cast out to the farthest part of the heavens, yet I will gather them from there, and bring them to the place which I have chosen as a dwelling for My name.’ Now these are Your servants and Your people, whom You have redeemed by Your great power, and by Your strong hand. O Lord, I pray, please let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of Your servant, and to the prayer of Your servants who desire to fear Your name; and let Your servant prosper this day, I pray, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.”\nFor I was the king’s cupbearer.",

Now I had never been sad in his presence before. Therefore the king said to me, “Why is your face sad, since you are not sick? This is nothing but sorrow of heart.”\nSo I became dreadfully afraid, and said to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ tombs, lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire?”\nThen the king said to me, “What do you request?”\nSo I prayed to the God of heaven. And I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ tombs, that I may rebuild it.”\nThen the king said to me (the queen also sitting beside him), “How long will your journey be? And when will you return?” So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.\nFurthermore I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, let letters be given to me for the governors of the region beyond the River, that they must permit me to pass through till I come to Judah, and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he must give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel which pertains to the temple, for the city wall, and for the house that I will occupy.” And the king granted them to me according to the good hand of my God upon me.\nThen I went to the governors in the region beyond the River, and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me. When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard of it, they were deeply disturbed that a man had come to seek the well-being of the children of Israel.\n\nSo I came to Jerusalem and was there three days. Then I arose in the night, I and a few men with me; I told no one what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem; nor was there any animal with me, except the one on which I rode. And I went out by night through the Valley Gate to the Serpent Well and the Refuse Gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and its gates which were burned with fire. Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the King’s Pool, but there was no room for the animal under me to pass. So I went up in the night by the valley, and viewed the wall; then I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned. And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done; I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, or the others who did the work.\nThen I said to them, “You see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come and let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no longer be a reproach.” And I told them of the hand of my God which had been good upon me, and also of the king’s words that he had spoken to me.\nSo they said, “Let us rise up and build.” Then they set their hands to this good work.\nBut when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard of it, they laughed at us and despised us, and said, “What is this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?”\nSo I answered them, and said to them, “The God of heaven Himself will prosper us; therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no heritage or right or memorial in Jerusalem.”",

And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they fortify themselves? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they complete it in a day? Will they revive the stones from the heaps of rubbish—stones that are burned?”\nNow Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him, and he said, “Whatever they build, if even a fox goes up on it, he will break down their stone wall.”\nHear, O our God, for we are despised; turn their reproach on their own heads, and give them as plunder to a land of captivity! Do not cover their iniquity, and do not let their sin be blotted out from before You; for they have provoked You to anger before the builders.\nSo we built the wall, and the entire wall was joined together up to half its height, for the people had a mind to work.\nNow it happened, when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were being restored and the gaps were beginning to be closed, that they became very angry, and all of them conspired together to come and attack Jerusalem and create confusion. Nevertheless we made our prayer to our God, and because of them we set a watch against them day and night.\nThen Judah said, “The strength of the laborers is failing, and there is so much rubbish that we are not able to build the wall.”\nAnd our adversaries said, “They will neither know nor see anything, till we come into their midst and kill them and cause the work to cease.”\nSo it was, when the Jews who dwelt near them came, that they told us ten times, “From whatever place you turn, they will be upon us.”\nTherefore I positioned men behind the lower parts of the wall, at the openings; and I set the people according to their families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows. And I looked, and arose and said to the nobles, to the leaders, and to the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, great and awesome, and fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses.”\nAnd it happened, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and that God had brought their plot to nothing, that all of us returned to the wall, everyone to his work. So it was, from that time on, that half of my servants worked at construction, while the other half held the spears, the shields, the bows, and wore armor; and the leaders were behind all the house of Judah. Those who built on the wall, and those who carried burdens, loaded themselves so that with one hand they worked at construction, and with the other held a weapon. Every one of the builders had his sword girded at his side as he built. And the one who sounded the trumpet was beside me.\nThen I said to the nobles, the rulers, and the rest of the people, “The work is great and extensive, and we are separated far from one another on the wall. Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us.”\nSo we labored in the work, and half of the men held the spears from daybreak until the stars appeared. At the same time I also said to the people, “Let each man and his servant stay at night in Jerusalem, that they may be our guard by night and a working party by day.” So neither I, my brethren, my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me took off our clothes, except that everyone took them off for washing.",

For there were those who said, “We, our sons, and our daughters are many; therefore let us get grain, that we may eat and live.”\nThere were also some who said, “We have mortgaged our lands and vineyards and houses, that we might buy grain because of the famine.”\nThere were also those who said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s tax on our lands and vineyards. Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children; and indeed we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and some of our daughters have been brought into slavery. It is not in our power to redeem them, for other men have our lands and vineyards.”\nAnd I became very angry when I heard their outcry and these words. After serious thought, I rebuked the nobles and rulers, and said to them, “Each of you is exacting usury from his brother.” So I called a great assembly against them. And I said to them, “According to our ability we have redeemed our Jewish brethren who were sold to the nations. Now indeed, will you even sell your brethren? Or should they be sold to us?”\nThen they were silenced and found nothing to say. Then I said, “What you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies? I also, with my brethren and my servants, am lending them money and grain. Please, let us stop this usury! Restore now to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, also a hundredth of the money and the grain, the new wine and the oil, that you have charged them.”\nSo they said, “We will restore it, and will require nothing from them; we will do as you say.”\nThen I called the priests, and required an oath from them that they would do according to this promise. Then I shook out the fold of my garment and said, “So may God shake out each man from his house, and from his property, who does not perform this promise. Even thus may he be shaken out and emptied.”\nAnd all the assembly said, “Amen!” and praised the LORD. Then the people did according to this promise.\n\nMoreover, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, twelve years, neither I nor my brothers ate the governor’s provisions. But the former governors who were before me laid burdens on the people, and took from them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver. Yes, even their servants bore rule over the people, but I did not do so, because of the fear of God. Indeed, I also continued the work on this wall, and we did not buy any land. All my servants were gathered there for the work.\nAnd at my table were one hundred and fifty Jews and rulers, besides those who came to us from the nations around us. Now that which was prepared daily was one ox and six choice sheep. Also fowl were prepared for me, and once every ten days an abundance of all kinds of wine. Yet in spite of this I did not demand the governor’s provisions, because the bondage was heavy on this people.\nRemember me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.",

Why should the work cease while I leave it and go down to you?”\nBut they sent me this message four times, and I answered them in the same manner.\nThen Sanballat sent his servant to me as before, the fifth time, with an open letter in his hand. In it was written:\nIt is reported among the nations, and Geshem says, that you and the Jews plan to rebel; therefore, according to these rumors, you are rebuilding the wall, that you may be their king. And you have also appointed prophets to proclaim concerning you at Jerusalem, saying, “There is a king in Judah!” Now these matters will be reported to the king. So come, therefore, and let us consult together.\nThen I sent to him, saying, “No such things as you say are being done, but you invent them in your own heart.”\nFor they all were trying to make us afraid, saying, “Their hands will be weakened in the work, and it will not be done.”\nNow therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.\nAfterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was a secret informer; and he said, “Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you; indeed, at night they will come to kill you.”\nAnd I said, “Should such a man as I flee? And who is there such as I who would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in!” Then I perceived that God had not sent him at all, but that he pronounced this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. For this reason he was hired, that I should be afraid and act that way and sin, so that they might have cause for an evil report, that they might reproach me.\nMy God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat, according to these their works, and the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who would have made me afraid.\n\nSo the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two days. And it happened, when all our enemies heard of it, and all the nations around us saw these things, that they were very disheartened in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was done by our God.\nAlso in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came to them. For many in Judah were pledged to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shechaniah the son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah. Also they reported his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to frighten me.",

      "chapter_text": "Then it was, when the wall was built and I had hung the doors, when the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites had been appointed, that I gave the charge of Jerusalem to my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the leader of the citadel, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many.\nAnd I said to them, “Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while they stand guard, let them shut and bar the doors; and appoint guards from among the inhabitants of Jerusalem, one at his watch station and another in front of his own house.”\n\nNow the city was large and spacious, but the people in it were few, and the houses were not rebuilt. Then my God put it into my heart to gather the nobles, the rulers, and the people, that they might be registered by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of those who had come up in the first return, and found written in it:\nThese are the people of the province who came back from the captivity, of those who had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, everyone to his city.\nThose who came with Zerubbabel were Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah.\nThe number of the men of the people of Israel: the sons of Parosh, two thousand one hundred and seventy-two;\nthe sons of Shephatiah, three hundred and seventy-two;\nthe sons of Arah, six hundred and fifty-two;\nthe sons of Pahath-Moab, of the sons of Jeshua and Joab, two thousand eight hundred and eighteen;\nthe sons of Elam, one thousand two hundred and fifty-four;\nthe sons of Zattu, eight hundred and forty-five;\nthe sons of Zaccai, seven hundred and sixty;\nthe sons of Binnui, six hundred and forty-eight;\nthe sons of Bebai, six hundred and twenty-eight;\nthe sons of Azgad, two thousand three hundred and twenty-two;\nthe sons of Adonikam, six hundred and sixty-seven;\nthe sons of Bigvai, two thousand and sixty-seven;\nthe sons of Adin, six hundred and fifty-five;\nthe sons of Ater of Hezekiah, ninety-eight;\nthe sons of Hashum, three hundred and twenty-eight;\nthe sons of Bezai, three hundred and twenty-four;\nthe sons of Hariph, one hundred and twelve;\nthe sons of Gibeon, ninety-five;\nthe men of Bethlehem and Netophah, one hundred and eighty-eight;\nthe men of Anathoth, one hundred and twenty-eight;\nthe men of Beth Azmaveth, forty-two;\nthe men of Kirjath Jearim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven hundred and forty-three;\nthe men of Ramah and Geba, six hundred and twenty-one;\nthe men of Michmas, one hundred and twenty-two;\nthe men of Bethel and Ai, one hundred and twenty-three;\nthe men of the other Nebo, fifty-two;\nthe sons of the other Elam, one thousand two hundred and fifty-four;\nthe sons of Harim, three hundred and twenty;\nthe sons of Jericho, three hundred and forty-five;\nthe sons of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred and twenty-one;\nthe sons of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred and thirty.\nThe priests: the sons of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine hundred and seventy-three;\nthe sons of Immer, one thousand and fifty-two;\nthe sons of Pashhur, one thousand two hundred and forty-seven;\nthe sons of Harim, one thousand and seventeen.\nThe Levites: the sons of Jeshua, of Kadmiel,\nand of the sons of Hodevah, seventy-four.\nThe singers: the sons of Asaph, one hundred and forty-eight.\nThe gatekeepers: the sons of Shallum,\nthe sons of Ater,\nthe sons of Talmon,\nthe sons of Akkub,\nthe sons of Hatita,\nthe sons of Shobai, one hundred and thirty-eight.\nThe Nethinim: the sons of Ziha,\nthe sons of Hasupha,\nthe sons of Tabbaoth,\nthe sons of Keros,\nthe sons of Sia,\nthe sons of Padon,\nthe sons of Lebana,\nthe sons of Hagaba,\nthe sons of Salmai,\nthe sons of Hanan,\nthe sons of Giddel,\nthe sons of Gahar,\nthe sons of Reaiah,\nthe sons of Rezin,\nthe sons of Nekoda,\nthe sons of Gazzam,\nthe sons of Uzza,\nthe sons of Paseah,\nthe sons of Besai,\nthe sons of Meunim,\nthe sons of Nephishesim,\nthe sons of Bakbuk,\nthe sons of Hakupha,\nthe sons of Harhur,\nthe sons of Bazlith,\nthe sons of Mehida,\nthe sons of Harsha,\nthe sons of Barkos,\nthe sons of Sisera,\nthe sons of Tamah,\nthe sons of Neziah,\nand the sons of Hatipha.\nThe sons of Solomon’s servants: the sons of Sotai,\nthe sons of Sophereth,\nthe sons of Perida,\nthe sons of Jaala,\nthe sons of Darkon,\nthe sons of Giddel,\nthe sons of Shephatiah,\nthe sons of Hattil,\nthe sons of Pochereth of Zebaim,\nand the sons of Amon.\nAll the Nethinim, and the sons of Solomon’s servants, were three hundred and ninety-two.\nAnd these were the ones who came up from Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer, but they could not identify their father’s house nor their lineage, whether they were of Israel: the sons of Delaiah,\nthe sons of Tobiah,\nthe sons of Nekoda, six hundred and forty-two;\nand of the priests: the sons of Habaiah,\nthe sons of Koz,\nthe sons of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called by their name.\nThese sought their listing among those who were registered by genealogy, but it was not found; therefore they were excluded from the priesthood as defiled. And the governor said to them that they should not eat of the most holy things till a priest could consult with the Urim and Thummim.\nAltogether the whole assembly was forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty, besides their male and female servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven; and they had two hundred and forty-five men and women singers. Their horses were seven hundred and thirty-six, their mules two hundred and forty-five, their camels four hundred and thirty-five, and donkeys six thousand seven hundred and twenty.\nAnd some of the heads of the fathers’ houses gave to the work. The governor gave to the treasury one thousand gold drachmas, fifty basins, and five hundred and thirty priestly garments. Some of the heads of the fathers’ houses gave to the treasury of the work twenty thousand gold drachmas, and two thousand two hundred silver minas. And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand gold drachmas, two thousand silver minas, and sixty-seven priestly garments.\nSo the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people, the Nethinim, and all Israel dwelt in their cities.\n\nWhen the seventh month came, the children of Israel were in their cities.",

So Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly of men and women and all who could hear with understanding on the first day of the seventh month. Then he read from it in the open square that was in front of the Water Gate from morning until midday, before the men and women and those who could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive to the Book of the Law.\nSo Ezra the scribe stood on a platform of wood which they had made for the purpose; and beside him, at his right hand, stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Urijah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah; and at his left hand Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam. And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people, for he was standing above all the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up. And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God.\nThen all the people answered, “Amen, Amen!” while lifting up their hands. And they bowed their heads and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground.\nAlso Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, helped the people to understand the Law; and the people stood in their place. So they read distinctly from the book, in the Law of God; and they gave the sense, and helped them to understand the reading.\nAnd Nehemiah, who was the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to all the people, “This day is holy to the LORD your God; do not mourn nor weep.” For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the Law.\nThen he said to them, “Go your way, eat the fat, drink the sweet, and send portions to those for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy to our Lord. Do not sorrow, for the joy of the LORD is your strength.”\nSo the Levites quieted all the people, saying, “Be still, for the day is holy; do not be grieved.” And all the people went their way to eat and drink, to send portions and rejoice greatly, because they understood the words that were declared to them.\n\nNow on the second day the heads of the fathers’ houses of all the people, with the priests and Levites, were gathered to Ezra the scribe, in order to understand the words of the Law. And they found written in the Law, which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths during the feast of the seventh month, and that they should announce and proclaim in all their cities and in Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the mountain, and bring olive branches, branches of oil trees, myrtle branches, palm branches, and branches of leafy trees, to make booths, as it is written.”\nThen the people went out and brought them and made themselves booths, each one on the roof of his house, or in their courtyards or the courts of the house of God, and in the open square of the Water Gate and in the open square of the Gate of Ephraim. So the whole assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and sat under the booths; for since the days of Joshua the son of Nun until that day the children of Israel had not done so. And there was very great gladness. Also day by day, from the first day until the last day, he read from the Book of the Law of God.

Then those of Israelite lineage separated themselves from all foreigners; and they stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers. And they stood up in their place and read from the Book of the Law of the LORD their God for one–fourth of the day; and for another fourth they confessed and worshiped the LORD their God.\nThen Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani stood on the stairs of the Levites and cried out with a loud voice to the LORD their God. And the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said:\n“Stand up and bless the LORD your God\nForever and ever!\n“Blessed be Your glorious name,\nWhich is exalted above all blessing and praise!\nYou alone are the LORD;\nYou have made heaven,\nThe heaven of heavens, with all their host,\nThe earth and everything on it,\nThe seas and all that is in them,\nAnd You preserve them all.\nThe host of heaven worships You.\n“You are the LORD God,\nWho chose Abram,\nAnd brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans,\nAnd gave him the name Abraham;\nYou found his heart faithful before You,\nAnd made a covenant with him\nTo give the land of the Canaanites,\nThe Hittites, the Amorites,\nThe Perizzites, the Jebusites,\nAnd the Girgashites—\nTo give it to his descendants.\nYou have performed Your words,\nFor You are righteous.\n“You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt,\nAnd heard their cry by the Red Sea.\nYou showed signs and wonders against Pharaoh,\nAgainst all his servants,\nAnd against all the people of his land.\nFor You knew that they acted proudly against them.\nSo You made a name for Yourself, as it is this day.\nAnd You divided the sea before them,\nSo that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land;\nAnd their persecutors You threw into the deep,\nAs a stone into the mighty waters.\nMoreover You led them by day with a cloudy pillar,\nAnd by night with a pillar of fire,\nTo give them light on the road\nWhich they should travel.\n“You came down also on Mount Sinai,\nAnd spoke with them from heaven,\nAnd gave them just ordinances and true laws,\nGood statutes and commandments.\nYou made known to them Your holy Sabbath,\nAnd commanded them precepts, statutes and laws,\nBy the hand of Moses Your servant.\nYou gave them bread from heaven for their hunger,\nAnd brought them water out of the rock for their thirst,\nAnd told them to go in to possess the land\nWhich You had sworn to give them.\n“But they and our fathers acted proudly,\nHardened their necks,\nAnd did not heed Your commandments.\nThey refused to obey,\nAnd they were not mindful of Your wonders\nThat You did among them.\nBut they hardened their necks,\nAnd in their rebellion\nThey appointed a leader\nTo return to their bondage.\nBut You are God,\nReady to pardon,\nGracious and merciful,\nSlow to anger,\nAbundant in kindness,\nAnd did not forsake them.\n“Even when they made a molded calf for themselves,\nAnd said, ‘This is your god\nThat brought you up out of Egypt,’\nAnd worked great provocations,\nYet in Your manifold mercies\nYou did not forsake them in the wilderness.\nThe pillar of the cloud did not depart from them by day,\nTo lead them on the road;\nNor the pillar of fire by night,\nTo show them light,\nAnd the way they should go.\nYou also gave Your good Spirit to instruct them,\nAnd did not withhold Your manna from their mouth,\nAnd gave them water for their thirst.\nForty years You sustained them in the wilderness;\nThey lacked nothing;\nTheir clothes did not wear out\nAnd their feet did not swell.\n“Moreover You gave them kingdoms and nations,\nAnd divided them into districts.\nSo they took possession of the land of Sihon,\nThe land of the king of Heshbon,\nAnd the land of Og king of Bashan.\nYou also multiplied their children as the stars of heaven,\nAnd brought them into the land\nWhich You had told their fathers\nTo go in and possess.\nSo the people went in\nAnd possessed the land;\nYou subdued before them the inhabitants of the land,\nThe Canaanites,\nAnd gave them into their hands,\nWith their kings\nAnd the people of the land,\nThat they might do with them as they wished.\nAnd they took strong cities and a rich land,\nAnd possessed houses full of all goods,\nCisterns already dug, vineyards, olive groves,\nAnd fruit trees in abundance.\nSo they ate and were filled and grew fat,\nAnd delighted themselves in Your great goodness.\n“Nevertheless they were disobedient\nAnd rebelled against You,\nCast Your law behind their backs\nAnd killed Your prophets, who testified against them\nTo turn them to Yourself;\nAnd they worked great provocations.\nTherefore You delivered them into the hand of their enemies,\nWho oppressed them;\nAnd in the time of their trouble,\nWhen they cried to You,\nYou heard from heaven;\nAnd according to Your abundant mercies\nYou gave them deliverers who saved them\nFrom the hand of their enemies.\n“But after they had rest,\nThey again did evil before You.\nTherefore You left them in the hand of their enemies,\nSo that they had dominion over them;\nYet when they returned and cried out to You,\nYou heard from heaven;\nAnd many times You delivered them according to Your mercies,\nAnd testified against them,\nThat You might bring them back to Your law.\nYet they acted proudly,\nAnd did not heed Your commandments,\nBut sinned against Your judgments,\n‘Which if a man does, he shall live by them.’\nAnd they shrugged their shoulders,\nStiffened their necks,\nAnd would not hear.\nYet for many years You had patience with them,\nAnd testified against them by Your Spirit in Your prophets.\nYet they would not listen;\nTherefore You gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.\nNevertheless in Your great mercy\nYou did not utterly consume them nor forsake them;\nFor You are God, gracious and merciful.\n“Now therefore, our God,\nThe great, the mighty, and awesome God,\nWho keeps covenant and mercy:\nDo not let all the trouble seem small before You\nThat has come upon us,\nOur kings and our princes,\nOur priests and our prophets,\nOur fathers and on all Your people,\nFrom the days of the kings of Assyria until this day.\nHowever You are just in all that has befallen us;\nFor You have dealt faithfully,\nBut we have done wickedly.\nNeither our kings nor our princes,\nOur priests nor our fathers,\nHave kept Your law,\nNor heeded Your commandments and Your testimonies,\nWith which You testified against them.\nFor they have not served You in their kingdom,\nOr in the many good things that You gave them,\nOr in the large and rich land which You set before them;\nNor did they turn from their wicked works.\n“Here we are, servants today!\nAnd the land that You gave to our fathers,\nTo eat its fruit and its bounty,\nHere we are, servants in it!\nAnd it yields much increase to the kings\nYou have set over us,\nBecause of our sins;\nAlso they have dominion over our bodies and our cattle\nAt their pleasure;\nAnd we are in great distress.\n“And because of all this,\nWe make a sure covenant and write it;\nOur leaders, our Levites, and our priests seal it.”",

And the people blessed all the men who willingly offered themselves to dwell at Jerusalem.\nThese are the heads of the province who dwelt in Jerusalem. (But in the cities of Judah everyone dwelt in his own possession in their cities—Israelites, priests, Levites, Nethinim, and descendants of Solomon’s servants.) Also in Jerusalem dwelt some of the children of Judah and of the children of Benjamin.\nThe children of Judah: Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, of the children of Perez; and Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Col-Hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of Shiloni. All the sons of Perez who dwelt at Jerusalem were four hundred and sixty-eight valiant men.\nAnd these are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah; and after him Gabbai and Sallai, nine hundred and twenty-eight. Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer, and Judah the son of Senuah was second over the city.\nOf the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, and Jachin; Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, was the leader of the house of God. Their brethren who did the work of the house were eight hundred and twenty-two; and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur, the son of Malchijah, and his brethren, heads of the fathers’ houses, were two hundred and forty-two; and Amashai the son of Azarel, the son of Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer, and their brethren, mighty men of valor, were one hundred and twenty-eight. Their overseer was Zabdiel the son of one of the great men.\nAlso of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni; Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the heads of the Levites, had the oversight of the business outside of the house of God; Mattaniah the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, the leader who began the thanksgiving with prayer; Bakbukiah, the second among his brethren; and Abda the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun. All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred and eighty-four.\nMoreover the gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren who kept the gates, were one hundred and seventy-two.\nAnd the rest of Israel, of the priests and Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, everyone in his inheritance. But the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel. And Ziha and Gishpa were over the Nethinim.\nAlso the overseer of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micha, of the sons of Asaph, the singers in charge of the service of the house of God. For it was the king’s command concerning them that a certain portion should be for the singers, a quota day by day. Pethahiah the son of Meshezabel, of the children of Zerah the son of Judah, was the king’s deputy in all matters concerning the people.\n\nAnd as for the villages with their fields, some of the children of Judah dwelt in Kirjath Arba and its villages, Dibon and its villages, Jekabzeel and its villages; in Jeshua, Moladah, Beth Pelet, Hazar Shual, and Beersheba and its villages; in Ziklag and Meconah and its villages; in En Rimmon, Zorah, Jarmuth, Zanoah, Adullam, and their villages; in Lachish and its fields; in Azekah and its villages. They dwelt from Beersheba to the Valley of Hinnom.\nAlso the children of Benjamin from Geba dwelt in Michmash, Aija, and Bethel, and their villages; in Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah; in Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim; in Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat; in Lod, Ono, and the Valley of Craftsmen.

Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, stood across from them in their duties.\nJeshua begot Joiakim, Joiakim begot Eliashib, Eliashib begot Joiada, Joiada begot Jonathan, and Jonathan begot Jaddua.\nNow in the days of Joiakim, the priests, the heads of the fathers’ houses were: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah; of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan; of Melichu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph; of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai; of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam; of Abijah, Zichri; the son of Minjamin; of Moadiah, Piltai; of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan; of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi; of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber; of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; and of Jedaiah, Nethanel.\nDuring the reign of Darius the Persian, a record was also kept of the Levites and priests who had been heads of their fathers’ houses in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua. The sons of Levi, the heads of the fathers’ houses until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib, were written in the book of the chronicles.\nAnd the heads of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers across from them, to praise and give thanks, group alternating with group, according to the command of David the man of God. Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers keeping the watch at the storerooms of the gates. These lived in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest, the scribe.\n\nNow at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought out the Levites in all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem to celebrate the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings and singing, with cymbals and stringed instruments and harps. And the sons of the singers gathered together from the countryside around Jerusalem, from the villages of the Netophathites, from the house of Gilgal, and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth; for the singers had built themselves villages all around Jerusalem. Then the priests and Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, the gates, and the wall.\nSo I brought the leaders of Judah up on the wall, and appointed two large thanksgiving choirs. One went to the right hand on the wall toward the Refuse Gate. After them went Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah, and Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, and some of the priests’ sons with trumpets—Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph, and his brethren, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God. Ezra the scribe went before them. By the Fountain Gate, in front of them, they went up the stairs of the City of David, on the stairway of the wall, beyond the house of David, as far as the Water Gate eastward.\nThe other thanksgiving choir went the opposite way, and I was behind them with half of the people on the wall, going past the Tower of the Ovens as far as the Broad Wall, and above the Gate of Ephraim, above the Old Gate, above the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate; and they stopped by the Gate of the Prison.\nSo the two thanksgiving choirs stood in the house of God, likewise I and the half of the rulers with me; and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Minjamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets; also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. The singers sang loudly with Jezrahiah the director.\nAlso that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy; the women and the children also rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard afar off.\n\nAnd at the same time some were appointed over the rooms of the storehouse for the offerings, the firstfruits, and the tithes, to gather into them from the fields of the cities the portions specified by the Law for the priests and Levites; for Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who ministered. Both the singers and the gatekeepers kept the charge of their God and the charge of the purification, according to the command of David and Solomon his son. For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chiefs of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. In the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah all Israel gave the portions for the singers and the gatekeepers, a portion for each day. They also consecrated holy things for the Levites, and the Levites consecrated them for the children of Aaron.",

      "chapter_text": "On that day they read from the Book of Moses in the hearing of the people, and in it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever come into the assembly of God, because they had not met the children of Israel with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them. However, our God turned the curse into a blessing. So it was, when they had heard the Law, that they separated all the mixed multitude from Israel.\n\nNow before this, Eliashib the priest, having authority over the storerooms of the house of our God, was allied with Tobiah. And he had prepared for him a large room, where previously they had stored the grain offerings, the frankincense, the articles, the tithes of grain, the new wine and oil, which were commanded to be given to the Levites and singers and gatekeepers, and the offerings for the priests. But during all this I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had returned to the king. Then after certain days I obtained leave from the king, and I came to Jerusalem and discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing a room for him in the courts of the house of God. And it grieved me bitterly; therefore I threw all the household goods of Tobiah out of the room. Then I commanded them to cleanse the rooms; and I brought back into them the articles of the house of God, with the grain offering and the frankincense.\nI also realized that the portions for the Levites had not been given them; for each of the Levites and the singers who did the work had gone back to his field. So I contended with the rulers, and said, “Why is the house of God forsaken?” And I gathered them together and set them in their place. Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the storehouse. And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouse Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were considered faithful, and their task was to distribute to their brethren.\nRemember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its services!\nIn those days I saw people in Judah treading wine presses on the Sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and loading donkeys with wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. And I warned them about the day on which they were selling provisions. Men of Tyre dwelt there also, who brought in fish and all kinds of goods, and sold them on the Sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.\nThen I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, “What evil thing is this that you do, by which you profane the Sabbath day? Did not your fathers do thus, and did not our God bring all this disaster on us and on this city? Yet you bring added wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.”\nSo it was, at the gates of Jerusalem, as it began to be dark before the Sabbath, that I commanded the gates to be shut, and charged that they must not be opened till after the Sabbath. Then I posted some of my servants at the gates, so that no burdens would be brought in on the Sabbath day. Now the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice.\nThen I warned them, and said to them, “Why do you spend the night around the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you!” From that time on they came no more on the Sabbath. And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should go and guard the gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day.\nRemember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of Your mercy!\nIn those days I also saw Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and could not speak the language of Judah, but spoke according to the language of one or the other people.\nSo I contended with them and cursed them, struck some of them and pulled out their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, “You shall not give your daughters as wives to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons or yourselves. Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among many nations there was no king like him, who was beloved of his God; and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless pagan women caused even him to sin. Should we then hear of your doing all this great evil, transgressing against our God by marrying pagan women?”\nAnd one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite; therefore I drove him from me.\nRemember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.\nThus I cleansed them of everything pagan. I also assigned duties to the priests and the Levites, each to his service, and to bringing the wood offering and the firstfruits at appointed times.\nRemember me, O my God, for good!",
