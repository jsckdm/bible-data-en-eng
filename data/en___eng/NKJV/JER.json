It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.\n\nThen the word of the LORD came to me, saying:\n“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you;\nBefore you were born I sanctified you;\nI ordained you a prophet to the nations.”\nThen said I:\n“Ah, Lord GOD!\nBehold, I cannot speak, for I am a youth.”\nBut the LORD said to me:\n“Do not say, ‘I am a youth,’\nFor you shall go to all to whom I send you,\nAnd whatever I command you, you shall speak.\nDo not be afraid of their faces,\nFor I am with you to deliver you,” says the LORD.\nThen the LORD put forth His hand and touched my mouth, and the LORD said to me:\n“Behold, I have put My words in your mouth.\nSee, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms,\nTo root out and to pull down,\nTo destroy and to throw down,\nTo build and to plant.”\nMoreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, “Jeremiah, what do you see?”\nAnd I said, “I see a branch of an almond tree.”\nThen the LORD said to me, “You have seen well, for I am ready to perform My word.”\nAnd the word of the LORD came to me the second time, saying, “What do you see?”\nAnd I said, “I see a boiling pot, and it is facing away from the north.”\nThen the LORD said to me:\n“Out of the north calamity shall break forth\nOn all the inhabitants of the land.\nFor behold, I am calling\nAll the families of the kingdoms of the north,” says the LORD;\n“They shall come and each one set his throne\nAt the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem,\nAgainst all its walls all around,\nAnd against all the cities of Judah.\nI will utter My judgments\nAgainst them concerning all their wickedness,\nBecause they have forsaken Me,\nBurned incense to other gods,\nAnd worshiped the works of their own hands.\n“Therefore prepare yourself and arise,\nAnd speak to them all that I command you.\nDo not be dismayed before their faces,\nLest I dismay you before them.\nFor behold, I have made you this day\nA fortified city and an iron pillar,\nAnd bronze walls against the whole land—\nAgainst the kings of Judah,\nAgainst its princes,\nAgainst its priests,\nAnd against the people of the land.\nThey will fight against you,\nBut they shall not prevail against you.\nFor I am with you,” says the LORD, “to deliver you.”",

Thus says the LORD:\n“What injustice have your fathers found in Me,\nThat they have gone far from Me,\nHave followed idols,\nAnd have become idolaters?\nNeither did they say, ‘Where is the LORD,\nWho brought us up out of the land of Egypt,\nWho led us through the wilderness,\nThrough a land of deserts and pits,\nThrough a land of drought and the shadow of death,\nThrough a land that no one crossed\nAnd where no one dwelt?’\nI brought you into a bountiful country,\nTo eat its fruit and its goodness.\nBut when you entered, you defiled My land\nAnd made My heritage an abomination.\nThe priests did not say, ‘Where is the LORD?’\nAnd those who handle the law did not know Me;\nThe rulers also transgressed against Me;\nThe prophets prophesied by Baal,\nAnd walked after things that do not profit.\n“Therefore I will yet bring charges against you,” says the LORD,\n“And against your children’s children I will bring charges.\nFor pass beyond the coasts of Cyprus and see,\nSend to Kedar and consider diligently,\nAnd see if there has been such a thing.\nHas a nation changed its gods,\nWhich are not gods?\nBut My people have changed their Glory\nFor what does not profit.\nBe astonished, O heavens, at this,\nAnd be horribly afraid;\nBe very desolate,” says the LORD.\n“For My people have committed two evils:\nThey have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters,\nAnd hewn themselves cisterns—broken cisterns that can hold no water.\n“Is Israel a servant?\nIs he a homeborn slave?\nWhy is he plundered?\nThe young lions roared at him, and growled;\nThey made his land waste;\nHis cities are burned, without inhabitant.\nAlso the people of Noph and Tahpanhes\nHave broken the crown of your head.\nHave you not brought this on yourself,\nIn that you have forsaken the LORD your God\nWhen He led you in the way?\nAnd now why take the road to Egypt,\nTo drink the waters of Sihor?\nOr why take the road to Assyria,\nTo drink the waters of the River?\nYour own wickedness will correct you,\nAnd your backslidings will rebuke you.\nKnow therefore and see that it is an evil and bitter thing\nThat you have forsaken the LORD your God,\nAnd the fear of Me is not in you,”\nSays the Lord GOD of hosts.\n“For of old I have broken your yoke and burst your bonds;\nAnd you said, ‘I will not transgress,’\nWhen on every high hill and under every green tree\nYou lay down, playing the harlot.\nYet I had planted you a noble vine, a seed of highest quality.\nHow then have you turned before Me\nInto the degenerate plant of an alien vine?\nFor though you wash yourself with lye, and use much soap,\nYet your iniquity is marked before Me,” says the Lord GOD.\n“How can you say, ‘I am not polluted,\nI have not gone after the Baals’?\nSee your way in the valley;\nKnow what you have done:\nYou are a swift dromedary breaking loose in her ways,\nA wild donkey used to the wilderness,\nThat sniffs at the wind in her desire;\nIn her time of mating, who can turn her away?\nAll those who seek her will not weary themselves;\nIn her month they will find her.\nWithhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst.\nBut you said, ‘There is no hope.\nNo! For I have loved aliens, and after them I will go.’\n“As the thief is ashamed when he is found out,\nSo is the house of Israel ashamed;\nThey and their kings and their princes, and their priests and their prophets,\nSaying to a tree, ‘You are my father,’\nAnd to a stone, ‘You gave birth to me.’\nFor they have turned their back to Me, and not their face.\nBut in the time of their trouble\nThey will say, ‘Arise and save us.’\nBut where are your gods that you have made for yourselves?\nLet them arise,\nIf they can save you in the time of your trouble;\nFor according to the number of your cities\nAre your gods, O Judah.\n“Why will you plead with Me?\nYou all have transgressed against Me,” says the LORD.\n“In vain I have chastened your children;\nThey received no correction.\nYour sword has devoured your prophets\nLike a destroying lion.\n“O generation, see the word of the LORD!\nHave I been a wilderness to Israel,\nOr a land of darkness?\nWhy do My people say, ‘We are lords;\nWe will come no more to You’?\nCan a virgin forget her ornaments,\nOr a bride her attire?\nYet My people have forgotten Me days without number.\n“Why do you beautify your way to seek love?\nTherefore you have also taught\nThe wicked women your ways.\nAlso on your skirts is found\nThe blood of the lives of the poor innocents.\nI have not found it by secret search,\nBut plainly on all these things.\nYet you say, ‘Because I am innocent,\nSurely His anger shall turn from me.’\nBehold, I will plead My case against you,\nBecause you say, ‘I have not sinned.’\nWhy do you gad about so much to change your way?\nAlso you shall be ashamed of Egypt as you were ashamed of Assyria.\nIndeed you will go forth from him\nWith your hands on your head;\nFor the LORD has rejected your trusted allies,\nAnd you will not prosper by them.",

She has gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and there played the harlot. And I said, after she had done all these things, ‘Return to Me.’ But she did not return. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it. Then I saw that for all the causes for which backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a certificate of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah did not fear, but went and played the harlot also. So it came to pass, through her casual harlotry, that she defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and trees. And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not turned to Me with her whole heart, but in pretense,” says the LORD.\nThen the LORD said to me, “Backsliding Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah. Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say:\n‘Return, backsliding Israel,’ says the LORD;\n‘I will not cause My anger to fall on you.\nFor I am merciful,’ says the LORD;\n‘I will not remain angry forever.\nOnly acknowledge your iniquity,\nThat you have transgressed against the LORD your God,\nAnd have scattered your charms\nTo alien deities under every green tree,\nAnd you have not obeyed My voice,’ says the LORD.\n“Return, O backsliding children,” says the LORD; “for I am married to you. I will take you, one from a city and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion. And I will give you shepherds according to My heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding.\n“Then it shall come to pass, when you are multiplied and increased in the land in those days,” says the LORD, “that they will say no more, ‘The ark of the covenant of the LORD.’ It shall not come to mind, nor shall they remember it, nor shall they visit it, nor shall it be made anymore.\n“At that time Jerusalem shall be called The Throne of the LORD, and all the nations shall be gathered to it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem. No more shall they follow the dictates of their evil hearts.\n“In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given as an inheritance to your fathers.\n“But I said:\n‘How can I put you among the children\nAnd give you a pleasant land,\nA beautiful heritage of the hosts of nations?’\n“And I said:\n‘You shall call Me, “My Father,”\nAnd not turn away from Me.’\nSurely, as a wife treacherously departs from her husband,\nSo have you dealt treacherously with Me,\nO house of Israel,” says the LORD.\nA voice was heard on the desolate heights,\nWeeping and supplications of the children of Israel.\nFor they have perverted their way;\nThey have forgotten the LORD their God.\n“Return, you backsliding children,\nAnd I will heal your backslidings.”\n“Indeed we do come to You,\nFor You are the LORD our God.\nTruly, in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills,\nAnd from the multitude of mountains;\nTruly, in the LORD our God\nIs the salvation of Israel.\nFor shame has devoured\nThe labor of our fathers from our youth—\nTheir flocks and their herds,\nTheir sons and their daughters.\nWe lie down in our shame,\nAnd our reproach covers us.\nFor we have sinned against the LORD our God,\nWe and our fathers,\nFrom our youth even to this day,\nAnd have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.”",

Do not delay!\nFor I will bring disaster from the north,\nAnd great destruction.”\nThe lion has come up from his thicket,\nAnd the destroyer of nations is on his way.\nHe has gone forth from his place\nTo make your land desolate.\nYour cities will be laid waste,\nWithout inhabitant.\nFor this, clothe yourself with sackcloth,\nLament and wail.\nFor the fierce anger of the LORD\nHas not turned back from us.\n“And it shall come to pass in that day,” says the LORD,\n“That the heart of the king shall perish,\nAnd the heart of the princes;\nThe priests shall be astonished,\nAnd the prophets shall wonder.”\nThen I said, “Ah, Lord GOD!\nSurely You have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem,\nSaying, ‘You shall have peace,’\nWhereas the sword reaches to the heart.”\nAt that time it will be said\nTo this people and to Jerusalem,\n“A dry wind of the desolate heights blows in the wilderness\nToward the daughter of My people—\nNot to fan or to cleanse—\nA wind too strong for these will come for Me;\nNow I will also speak judgment against them.”\n“Behold, he shall come up like clouds,\nAnd his chariots like a whirlwind.\nHis horses are swifter than eagles.\nWoe to us, for we are plundered!”\nO Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness,\nThat you may be saved.\nHow long shall your evil thoughts lodge within you?\nFor a voice declares from Dan\nAnd proclaims affliction from Mount Ephraim:\n“Make mention to the nations,\nYes, proclaim against Jerusalem,\nThat watchers come from a far country\nAnd raise their voice against the cities of Judah.\nLike keepers of a field they are against her all around,\nBecause she has been rebellious against Me,” says the LORD.\n“Your ways and your doings\nHave procured these things for you.\nThis is your wickedness,\nBecause it is bitter,\nBecause it reaches to your heart.”\n\nO my soul, my soul!\nI am pained in my very heart!\nMy heart makes a noise in me;\nI cannot hold my peace,\nBecause you have heard, O my soul,\nThe sound of the trumpet,\nThe alarm of war.\nDestruction upon destruction is cried,\nFor the whole land is plundered.\nSuddenly my tents are plundered,\nAnd my curtains in a moment.\nHow long will I see the standard,\nAnd hear the sound of the trumpet?\n“For My people are foolish,\nThey have not known Me.\nThey are silly children,\nAnd they have no understanding.\nThey are wise to do evil,\nBut to do good they have no knowledge.”\nI beheld the earth, and indeed it was without form, and void;\nAnd the heavens, they had no light.\nI beheld the mountains, and indeed they trembled,\nAnd all the hills moved back and forth.\nI beheld, and indeed there was no man,\nAnd all the birds of the heavens had fled.\nI beheld, and indeed the fruitful land was a wilderness,\nAnd all its cities were broken down\nAt the presence of the LORD,\nBy His fierce anger.\nFor thus says the LORD:\n“The whole land shall be desolate;\nYet I will not make a full end.\nFor this shall the earth mourn,\nAnd the heavens above be black,\nBecause I have spoken.\nI have purposed and will not relent,\nNor will I turn back from it.\nThe whole city shall flee from the noise of the horsemen and bowmen.\nThey shall go into thickets and climb up on the rocks.\nEvery city shall be forsaken,\nAnd not a man shall dwell in it.\n“And when you are plundered,\nWhat will you do?\nThough you clothe yourself with crimson,\nThough you adorn yourself with ornaments of gold,\nThough you enlarge your eyes with paint,\nIn vain you will make yourself fair;\nYour lovers will despise you;\nThey will seek your life.\n“For I have heard a voice as of a woman in labor,\nThe anguish as of her who brings forth her first child,\nThe voice of the daughter of Zion bewailing herself;\nShe spreads her hands, saying,\n‘Woe is me now, for my soul is weary\nBecause of murderers!’",

And it will be when you say, ‘Why does the LORD our God do all these things to us?’ then you shall answer them, ‘Just as you have forsaken Me and served foreign gods in your land, so you shall serve aliens in a land that is not yours.’\n“Declare this in the house of Jacob\nAnd proclaim it in Judah, saying,\n‘Hear this now, O foolish people,\nWithout understanding,\nWho have eyes and see not,\nAnd who have ears and hear not:\nDo you not fear Me?’ says the LORD.\n‘Will you not tremble at My presence,\nWho have placed the sand as the bound of the sea,\nBy a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass beyond it?\nAnd though its waves toss to and fro,\nYet they cannot prevail;\nThough they roar, yet they cannot pass over it.\nBut this people has a defiant and rebellious heart;\nThey have revolted and departed.\nThey do not say in their heart,\n“Let us now fear the LORD our God,\nWho gives rain, both the former and the latter, in its season.\nHe reserves for us the appointed weeks of the harvest.”\nYour iniquities have turned these things away,\nAnd your sins have withheld good from you.\n‘For among My people are found wicked men;\nThey lie in wait as one who sets snares;\nThey set a trap;\nThey catch men.\nAs a cage is full of birds,\nSo their houses are full of deceit.\nTherefore they have become great and grown rich.\nThey have grown fat, they are sleek;\nYes, they surpass the deeds of the wicked;\nThey do not plead the cause,\nThe cause of the fatherless;\nYet they prosper,\nAnd the right of the needy they do not defend.\nShall I not punish them for these things?’ says the LORD.\n‘Shall I not avenge Myself on such a nation as this?’\n“An astonishing and horrible thing\nHas been committed in the land:\nThe prophets prophesy falsely,\nAnd the priests rule by their own power;\nAnd My people love to have it so.\nBut what will you do in the end?",

They were not at all ashamed;\nNor did they know how to blush.\nTherefore they shall fall among those who fall;\nAt the time I punish them,\nThey shall be cast down,” says the LORD.\nThus says the LORD:\n“Stand in the ways and see,\nAnd ask for the old paths, where the good way is,\nAnd walk in it;\nThen you will find rest for your souls.\nBut they said, ‘We will not walk in it.’\nAlso, I set watchmen over you, saying,\n‘Listen to the sound of the trumpet!’\nBut they said, ‘We will not listen.’\nTherefore hear, you nations,\nAnd know, O congregation, what is among them.\nHear, O earth!\nBehold, I will certainly bring calamity on this people—\nThe fruit of their thoughts,\nBecause they have not heeded My words\nNor My law, but rejected it.\nFor what purpose to Me\nComes frankincense from Sheba,\nAnd sweet cane from a far country?\nYour burnt offerings are not acceptable,\nNor your sacrifices sweet to Me.”\nTherefore thus says the LORD:\n“Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks before this people,\nAnd the fathers and the sons together shall fall on them.\nThe neighbor and his friend shall perish.”\nThus says the LORD:\n“Behold, a people comes from the north country,\nAnd a great nation will be raised from the farthest parts of the earth.\nThey will lay hold on bow and spear;\nThey are cruel and have no mercy;\nTheir voice roars like the sea;\nAnd they ride on horses,\nAs men of war set in array against you, O daughter of Zion.”\nWe have heard the report of it;\nOur hands grow feeble.\nAnguish has taken hold of us,\nPain as of a woman in labor.\nDo not go out into the field,\nNor walk by the way.\nBecause of the sword of the enemy,\nFear is on every side.\nO daughter of my people,\nDress in sackcloth\nAnd roll about in ashes!\nMake mourning as for an only son, most bitter lamentation;\nFor the plunderer will suddenly come upon us.\n“I have set you as an assayer and a fortress among My people,\nThat you may know and test their way.\nThey are all stubborn rebels, walking as slanderers.\nThey are bronze and iron,\nThey are all corrupters;\nThe bellows blow fiercely,\nThe lead is consumed by the fire;\nThe smelter refines in vain,\nFor the wicked are not drawn off.\nPeople will call them rejected silver,\nBecause the LORD has rejected them.”",

      "chapter_text": "The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, “Stand in the gate of the LORD’s house, and proclaim there this word, and say, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah who enter in at these gates to worship the LORD!’ ” Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: “Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place. Do not trust in these lying words, saying, ‘The temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD, the temple of the LORD are these.’\n“For if you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings, if you thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbor, if you do not oppress the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place, or walk after other gods to your hurt, then I will cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers forever and ever.\n“Behold, you trust in lying words that cannot profit. Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, burn incense to Baal, and walk after other gods whom you do not know, and then come and stand before Me in this house which is called by My name, and say, ‘We are delivered to do all these abominations’? Has this house, which is called by My name, become a den of thieves in your eyes? Behold, I, even I, have seen it,” says the LORD.\n“But go now to My place which was in Shiloh, where I set My name at the first, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of My people Israel. And now, because you have done all these works,” says the LORD, “and I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you did not hear, and I called you, but you did not answer, therefore I will do to the house which is called by My name, in which you trust, and to this place which I gave to you and your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh. And I will cast you out of My sight, as I have cast out all your brethren—the whole posterity of Ephraim.\n“Therefore do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry or prayer for them, nor make intercession to Me; for I will not hear you. Do you not see what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? The children gather wood, the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes for the queen of heaven; and they pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke Me to anger. Do they provoke Me to anger?” says the LORD. “Do they not provoke themselves, to the shame of their own faces?”\nTherefore thus says the Lord GOD: “Behold, My anger and My fury will be poured out on this place—on man and on beast, on the trees of the field and on the fruit of the ground. And it will burn and not be quenched.”\nThus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: “Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat meat. For I did not speak to your fathers, or command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices. But this is what I commanded them, saying, ‘Obey My voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be My people. And walk in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well with you.’ Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but followed the counsels and the dictates of their evil hearts, and went backward and not forward. Since the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt until this day, I have even sent to you all My servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them. Yet they did not obey Me or incline their ear, but stiffened their neck. They did worse than their fathers.\n“Therefore you shall speak all these words to them, but they will not obey you. You shall also call to them, but they will not answer you.\n\n“So you shall say to them, ‘This is a nation that does not obey the voice of the LORD their God nor receive correction. Truth has perished and has been cut off from their mouth. Cut off your hair and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on the desolate heights; for the LORD has rejected and forsaken the generation of His wrath.’ For the children of Judah have done evil in My sight,” says the LORD. “They have set their abominations in the house which is called by My name, to pollute it. And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command, nor did it come into My heart.\n“Therefore behold, the days are coming,” says the LORD, “when it will no more be called Tophet, or the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter; for they will bury in Tophet until there is no room. The corpses of this people will be food for the birds of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth. And no one will frighten them away. Then I will cause to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride. For the land shall be desolate.",

They shall spread them before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven, which they have loved and which they have served and after which they have walked, which they have sought and which they have worshiped. They shall not be gathered nor buried; they shall be like refuse on the face of the earth. Then death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of those who remain of this evil family, who remain in all the places where I have driven them,” says the LORD of hosts.\n\n“Moreover you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD:\n“Will they fall and not rise?\nWill one turn away and not return?\nWhy has this people slidden back,\nJerusalem, in a perpetual backsliding?\nThey hold fast to deceit,\nThey refuse to return.\nI listened and heard,\nBut they do not speak aright.\nNo man repented of his wickedness,\nSaying, ‘What have I done?’\nEveryone turned to his own course,\nAs the horse rushes into the battle.\n“Even the stork in the heavens\nKnows her appointed times;\nAnd the turtledove, the swift, and the swallow\nObserve the time of their coming.\nBut My people do not know the judgment of the LORD.\n“How can you say, ‘We are wise,\nAnd the law of the LORD is with us’?\nLook, the false pen of the scribe certainly works falsehood.\nThe wise men are ashamed,\nThey are dismayed and taken.\nBehold, they have rejected the word of the LORD;\nSo what wisdom do they have?\nTherefore I will give their wives to others,\nAnd their fields to those who will inherit them;\nBecause from the least even to the greatest\nEveryone is given to covetousness;\nFrom the prophet even to the priest\nEveryone deals falsely.\nFor they have healed the hurt of the daughter of My people slightly,\nSaying, ‘Peace, peace!’\nWhen there is no peace.\nWere they ashamed when they had committed abomination?\nNo! They were not at all ashamed,\nNor did they know how to blush.\nTherefore they shall fall among those who fall;\nIn the time of their punishment\nThey shall be cast down,” says the LORD.\n“I will surely consume them,” says the LORD.\n“No grapes shall be on the vine,\nNor figs on the fig tree,\nAnd the leaf shall fade;\nAnd the things I have given them shall pass away from them.” ’ ”\n“Why do we sit still?\nAssemble yourselves,\nAnd let us enter the fortified cities,\nAnd let us be silent there.\nFor the LORD our God has put us to silence\nAnd given us water of gall to drink,\nBecause we have sinned against the LORD.\n“We looked for peace, but no good came;\nAnd for a time of health, and there was trouble!\nThe snorting of His horses was heard from Dan.\nThe whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of His strong ones;\nFor they have come and devoured the land and all that is in it,\nThe city and those who dwell in it.”\n“For behold, I will send serpents among you,\nVipers which cannot be charmed,\nAnd they shall bite you,” says the LORD.\n\nI would comfort myself in sorrow;\nMy heart is faint in me.\nListen! The voice,\nThe cry of the daughter of my people\nFrom a far country:\n“Is not the LORD in Zion?\nIs not her King in her?”\n“Why have they provoked Me to anger\nWith their carved images—\nWith foreign idols?”\n“The harvest is past,\nThe summer is ended,\nAnd we are not saved!”\nFor the hurt of the daughter of my people I am hurt.\nI am mourning;\nAstonishment has taken hold of me.\nIs there no balm in Gilead,\nIs there no physician there?\nWhy then is there no recovery\nFor the health of the daughter of my people?",

And who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD has spoken, that he may declare it? Why does the land perish and burn up like a wilderness, so that no one can pass through?\nAnd the LORD said, “Because they have forsaken My law which I set before them, and have not obeyed My voice, nor walked according to it, but they have walked according to the dictates of their own hearts and after the Baals, which their fathers taught them,” therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: “Behold, I will feed them, this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink. I will scatter them also among the Gentiles, whom neither they nor their fathers have known. And I will send a sword after them until I have consumed them.”\n\nThus says the LORD of hosts:\n“Consider and call for the mourning women,\nThat they may come;\nAnd send for skillful wailing women,\nThat they may come.\nLet them make haste\nAnd take up a wailing for us,\nThat our eyes may run with tears,\nAnd our eyelids gush with water.\nFor a voice of wailing is heard from Zion:\n‘How we are plundered!\nWe are greatly ashamed,\nBecause we have forsaken the land,\nBecause we have been cast out of our dwellings.’ ”\nYet hear the word of the LORD, O women,\nAnd let your ear receive the word of His mouth;\nTeach your daughters wailing,\nAnd everyone her neighbor a lamentation.\nFor death has come through our windows,\nHas entered our palaces,\nTo kill off the children— no longer to be outside!\nAnd the young men— no longer on the streets!\nSpeak, “Thus says the LORD:\n‘Even the carcasses of men shall fall as refuse on the open field,\nLike cuttings after the harvester,\nAnd no one shall gather them.’ ”\nThus says the LORD:\n“Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,\nLet not the mighty man glory in his might,\nNor let the rich man glory in his riches;\nBut let him who glories glory in this,\nThat he understands and knows Me,\nThat I am the LORD, exercising lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness in the earth.\nFor in these I delight,” says the LORD.\n“Behold, the days are coming,” says the LORD, “that I will punish all who are circumcised with the uncircumcised— Egypt, Judah, Edom, the people of Ammon, Moab, and all who are in the farthest corners, who dwell in the wilderness. For all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.”",

For I earnestly exhorted your fathers in the day I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, until this day, rising early and exhorting, saying, “Obey My voice.” Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but everyone followed the dictates of his evil heart; therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but which they have not done.’ ”\nAnd the LORD said to me, “A conspiracy has been found among the men of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers who refused to hear My words, and they have gone after other gods to serve them; the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their fathers.”\nTherefore thus says the LORD: “Behold, I will surely bring calamity on them which they will not be able to escape; and though they cry out to Me, I will not listen to them. Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they offer incense, but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble. For according to the number of your cities were your gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem you have set up altars to that shameful thing, altars to burn incense to Baal.\n“So do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry out to Me because of their trouble.\n“What has My beloved to do in My house,\nHaving done lewd deeds with many?\nAnd the holy flesh has passed from you.\nWhen you do evil, then you rejoice.\nThe LORD called your name,\nGreen Olive Tree, Lovely and of Good Fruit.\nWith the noise of a great tumult\nHe has kindled fire on it,\nAnd its branches are broken.\n“For the LORD of hosts, who planted you, has pronounced doom against you for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke Me to anger in offering incense to Baal.”\n\nNow the LORD gave me knowledge of it, and I know it; for You showed me their doings. But I was like a docile lamb brought to the slaughter; and I did not know that they had devised schemes against me, saying, “Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be remembered no more.”\nBut, O LORD of hosts,\nYou who judge righteously,\nTesting the mind and the heart,\nLet me see Your vengeance on them,\nFor to You I have revealed my cause.\n“Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the men of Anathoth who seek your life, saying, ‘Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD, lest you die by our hand’— therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: ‘Behold, I will punish them. The young men shall die by the sword, their sons and their daughters shall die by famine; and there shall be no remnant of them, for I will bring catastrophe on the men of Anathoth, even the year of their punishment.’ ”",

Then it shall be, after I have plucked them out, that I will return and have compassion on them and bring them back, everyone to his heritage and everyone to his land. And it shall be, if they will learn carefully the ways of My people, to swear by My name, ‘As the LORD lives,’ as they taught My people to swear by Baal, then they shall be established in the midst of My people. But if they do not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation,” says the LORD.",

It was profitable for nothing.\nThen the word of the LORD came to me, saying, “Thus says the LORD: ‘In this manner I will ruin the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem. This evil people, who refuse to hear My words, who follow the dictates of their hearts, and walk after other gods to serve them and worship them, shall be just like this sash which is profitable for nothing. For as the sash clings to the waist of a man, so I have caused the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah to cling to Me,’ says the LORD, ‘that they may become My people, for renown, for praise, and for glory; but they would not hear.’\n\n“Therefore you shall speak to them this word: ‘Thus says the LORD God of Israel: “Every bottle shall be filled with wine.” ’\nAnd they will say to you, ‘Do we not certainly know that every bottle will be filled with wine?’\n“Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD: “Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land—even the kings who sit on David’s throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem—with drunkenness! And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together,” says the LORD. “I will not pity nor spare nor have mercy, but will destroy them.” ’ ”\n\nHear and give ear:\nDo not be proud,\nFor the LORD has spoken.\nGive glory to the LORD your God\nBefore He causes darkness,\nAnd before your feet stumble\nOn the dark mountains,\nAnd while you are looking for light,\nHe turns it into the shadow of death\nAnd makes it dense darkness.\nBut if you will not hear it,\nMy soul will weep in secret for your pride;\nMy eyes will weep bitterly\nAnd run down with tears,\nBecause the LORD’s flock has been taken captive.\nSay to the king and to the queen mother,\n“Humble yourselves;\nSit down,\nFor your rule shall collapse, the crown of your glory.”\nThe cities of the South shall be shut up,\nAnd no one shall open them;\nJudah shall be carried away captive, all of it;\nIt shall be wholly carried away captive.\nLift up your eyes and see\nThose who come from the north.\nWhere is the flock that was given to you,\nYour beautiful sheep?\nWhat will you say when He punishes you?\nFor you have taught them\nTo be chieftains, to be head over you.\nWill not pangs seize you,\nLike a woman in labor?\nAnd if you say in your heart,\n“Why have these things come upon me?”\nFor the greatness of your iniquity\nYour skirts have been uncovered,\nYour heels made bare.\nCan the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard its spots?\nThen may you also do good who are accustomed to do evil.\n“Therefore I will scatter them like stubble\nThat passes away by the wind of the wilderness.\nThis is your lot,\nThe portion of your measures from Me,” says the LORD,\n“Because you have forgotten Me\nAnd trusted in falsehood.\nTherefore I will uncover your skirts over your face,\nThat your shame may appear.\nI have seen your adulteries\nAnd your lustful neighings,\nThe lewdness of your harlotry,\nYour abominations on the hills in the fields.\nWoe to you, O Jerusalem!\nWill you still not be made clean?”",

When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I will not accept them. But I will consume them by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.”\nThen I said, “Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, the prophets say to them, ‘You shall not see the sword, nor shall you have famine, but I will give you assured peace in this place.’ ”\nAnd the LORD said to me, “The prophets prophesy lies in My name. I have not sent them, commanded them, nor spoken to them; they prophesy to you a false vision, divination, a worthless thing, and the deceit of their heart. Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the prophets who prophesy in My name, whom I did not send, and who say, ‘Sword and famine shall not be in this land’—‘By sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed! And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; they will have no one to bury them—them nor their wives, their sons nor their daughters—for I will pour their wickedness on them.’\n“Therefore you shall say this word to them:\n‘Let my eyes flow with tears night and day,\nAnd let them not cease;\nFor the virgin daughter of my people\nHas been broken with a mighty stroke, with a very severe blow.\nIf I go out to the field,\nThen behold, those slain with the sword!\nAnd if I enter the city,\nThen behold, those sick from famine!\nYes, both prophet and priest go about in a land they do not know.’ ”\n\nHave You utterly rejected Judah?\nHas Your soul loathed Zion?\nWhy have You stricken us so that there is no healing for us?\nWe looked for peace, but there was no good;\nAnd for the time of healing, and there was trouble.\nWe acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness\nAnd the iniquity of our fathers,\nFor we have sinned against You.\nDo not abhor us, for Your name’s sake;\nDo not disgrace the throne of Your glory.\nRemember, do not break Your covenant with us.\nAre there any among the idols of the nations that can cause rain?\nOr can the heavens give showers?\nAre You not He, O LORD our God?\nTherefore we will wait for You,\nSince You have made all these.",

They shall be consumed by the sword and by famine, and their corpses shall be meat for the birds of heaven and for the beasts of the earth.”\nFor thus says the LORD: “Do not enter the house of mourning, nor go to lament or bemoan them; for I have taken away My peace from this people,” says the LORD, “lovingkindness and mercies. Both the great and the small shall die in this land. They shall not be buried; neither shall men lament for them, cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them. Nor shall men break bread in mourning for them, to comfort them for the dead; nor shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or their mother. Also you shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them, to eat and drink.”\nFor thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: “Behold, I will cause to cease from this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.\n“And it shall be, when you show this people all these words, and they say to you, ‘Why has the LORD pronounced all this great disaster against us? Or what is our iniquity? Or what is our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?’ then you shall say to them, ‘Because your fathers have forsaken Me,’ says the LORD; ‘they have walked after other gods and have served them and worshiped them, and have forsaken Me and not kept My law. And you have done worse than your fathers, for behold, each one follows the dictates of his own evil heart, so that no one listens to Me. Therefore I will cast you out of this land into a land that you do not know, neither you nor your fathers; and there you shall serve other gods day and night, where I will not show you favor.’\n\n“Therefore behold, the days are coming,” says the LORD, “that it shall no more be said, ‘The LORD lives who brought up the children of Israel from the land of Egypt,’ but, ‘The LORD lives who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north and from all the lands where He had driven them.’ For I will bring them back into their land which I gave to their fathers.\n“Behold, I will send for many fishermen,” says the LORD, “and they shall fish them; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain and every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks. For My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from My face, nor is their iniquity hidden from My eyes. And first I will repay double for their iniquity and their sin, because they have defiled My land; they have filled My inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable idols.”\nO LORD, my strength and my fortress,\nMy refuge in the day of affliction,\nThe Gentiles shall come to You\nFrom the ends of the earth and say,\n“Surely our fathers have inherited lies,\nWorthlessness and unprofitable things.”\nWill a man make gods for himself,\nWhich are not gods?\n“Therefore behold, I will this once cause them to know,\nI will cause them to know\nMy hand and My might;\nAnd they shall know that My name is the LORD.",

Thus says the LORD: “Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the Sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem; nor carry a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day, nor do any work, but hallow the Sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers. But they did not obey nor incline their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear nor receive instruction.\n“And it shall be, if you heed Me carefully,” says the LORD, “to bring no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, but hallow the Sabbath day, to do no work in it, then shall enter the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their princes, accompanied by the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city shall remain forever. And they shall come from the cities of Judah and from the places around Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin and from the lowland, from the mountains and from the South, bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and incense, bringing sacrifices of praise to the house of the LORD.\n“But if you will not heed Me to hallow the Sabbath day, such as not carrying a burden when entering the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in its gates, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.” ’ ”",

And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter; so he made it again into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make.\nThen the word of the LORD came to me, saying: “O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter?” says the LORD. “Look, as the clay is in the potter’s hand, so are you in My hand, O house of Israel! The instant I speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, to pull down, and to destroy it, if that nation against whom I have spoken turns from its evil, I will relent of the disaster that I thought to bring upon it. And the instant I speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it, if it does evil in My sight so that it does not obey My voice, then I will relent concerning the good with which I said I would benefit it.\n“Now therefore, speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD: “Behold, I am fashioning a disaster and devising a plan against you. Return now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.” ’ ”\n\nAnd they said, “That is hopeless! So we will walk according to our own plans, and we will every one obey the dictates of his evil heart.”\nTherefore thus says the LORD:\n“Ask now among the Gentiles,\nWho has heard such things?\nThe virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing.\nWill a man leave the snow water of Lebanon,\nWhich comes from the rock of the field?\nWill the cold flowing waters be forsaken for strange waters?\n“Because My people have forgotten Me,\nThey have burned incense to worthless idols.\nAnd they have caused themselves to stumble in their ways,\nFrom the ancient paths,\nTo walk in pathways and not on a highway,\nTo make their land desolate and a perpetual hissing;\nEveryone who passes by it will be astonished\nAnd shake his head.\nI will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy;\nI will show them the back and not the face\nIn the day of their calamity.”\n\nThen they said, “Come and let us devise plans against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come and let us attack him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.”\nGive heed to me, O LORD,\nAnd listen to the voice of those who contend with me!\nShall evil be repaid for good?\nFor they have dug a pit for my life.\nRemember that I stood before You\nTo speak good for them,\nTo turn away Your wrath from them.\nTherefore deliver up their children to the famine,\nAnd pour out their blood\nBy the force of the sword;\nLet their wives become widows\nAnd bereaved of their children.\nLet their men be put to death,\nTheir young men be slain\nBy the sword in battle.\nLet a cry be heard from their houses,\nWhen You bring a troop suddenly upon them;\nFor they have dug a pit to take me,\nAnd hidden snares for my feet.\nYet, LORD, You know all their counsel\nWhich is against me, to slay me.\nProvide no atonement for their iniquity,\nNor blot out their sin from Your sight;\nBut let them be overthrown before You.\nDeal thus with them\nIn the time of Your anger.",

Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: “Behold, I will bring such a catastrophe on this place, that whoever hears of it, his ears will tingle.\n“Because they have forsaken Me and made this an alien place, because they have burned incense in it to other gods whom neither they, their fathers, nor the kings of Judah have known, and have filled this place with the blood of the innocents (they have also built the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings to Baal, which I did not command or speak, nor did it come into My mind), therefore behold, the days are coming,” says the LORD, “that this place shall no more be called Tophet or the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter. And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place, and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hands of those who seek their lives; their corpses I will give as meat for the birds of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth. I will make this city desolate and a hissing; everyone who passes by it will be astonished and hiss because of all its plagues. And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and everyone shall eat the flesh of his friend in the siege and in the desperation with which their enemies and those who seek their lives shall drive them to despair.” ’\n“Then you shall break the flask in the sight of the men who go with you, and say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts: “Even so I will break this people and this city, as one breaks a potter’s vessel, which cannot be made whole again; and they shall bury them in Tophet till there is no place to bury.

Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD.\nAnd it happened on the next day that Pashhur brought Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, “The LORD has not called your name Pashhur, but Magor-Missabib. For thus says the LORD: ‘Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes shall see it. I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive to Babylon and slay them with the sword. Moreover I will deliver all the wealth of this city, all its produce, and all its precious things; all the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give into the hand of their enemies, who will plunder them, seize them, and carry them to Babylon. And you, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house, shall go into captivity. You shall go to Babylon, and there you shall die, and be buried there, you and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied lies.’ ”\n\nO LORD, You induced me, and I was persuaded;\nYou are stronger than I, and have prevailed.\nI am in derision daily;\nEveryone mocks me.\nFor when I spoke, I cried out;\nI shouted, “Violence and plunder!”\nBecause the word of the LORD was made to me\nA reproach and a derision daily.\nThen I said, “I will not make mention of Him,\nNor speak anymore in His name.”\nBut His word was in my heart like a burning fire\nShut up in my bones;\nI was weary of holding it back,\nAnd I could not.\nFor I heard many mocking:\n“Fear on every side!”\n“Report,” they say, “and we will report it!”\nAll my acquaintances watched for my stumbling, saying,\n“Perhaps he can be induced;\nThen we will prevail against him,\nAnd we will take our revenge on him.”\nBut the LORD is with me as a mighty, awesome One.\nTherefore my persecutors will stumble, and will not prevail.\nThey will be greatly ashamed, for they will not prosper.\nTheir everlasting confusion will never be forgotten.\nBut, O LORD of hosts,\nYou who test the righteous,\nAnd see the mind and heart,\nLet me see Your vengeance on them;\nFor I have pleaded my cause before You.\nSing to the LORD! Praise the LORD!\nFor He has delivered the life of the poor\nFrom the hand of evildoers.\nCursed be the day in which I was born!\nLet the day not be blessed in which my mother bore me!\nLet the man be cursed\nWho brought news to my father, saying,\n“A male child has been born to you!”\nMaking him very glad.\nAnd let that man be like the cities\nWhich the LORD overthrew, and did not relent;\nLet him hear the cry in the morning\nAnd the shouting at noon,\nBecause he did not kill me from the womb,\nThat my mother might have been my grave,\nAnd her womb always enlarged with me.\nWhy did I come forth from the womb to see labor and sorrow,\nThat my days should be consumed with shame?",

Perhaps the LORD will deal with us according to all His wonderful works, that the king may go away from us.”\nThen Jeremiah said to them, “Thus you shall say to Zedekiah, ‘Thus says the LORD God of Israel: “Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which you fight against the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who besiege you outside the walls; and I will assemble them in the midst of this city. I Myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger and fury and great wrath. I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; they shall die of a great pestilence. And afterward,” says the LORD, “I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, his servants and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence and the sword and the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those who seek their life; and he shall strike them with the edge of the sword. He shall not spare them, or have pity or mercy.” ’\n“Now you shall say to this people, ‘Thus says the LORD: “Behold, I set before you the way of life and the way of death. He who remains in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence; but he who goes out and defects to the Chaldeans who besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be as a prize to him. For I have set My face against this city for adversity and not for good,” says the LORD. “It shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.” ’\n\n“And concerning the house of the king of Judah, say, ‘Hear the word of the LORD, O house of David! Thus says the LORD:\n“Execute judgment in the morning;\nAnd deliver him who is plundered\nOut of the hand of the oppressor,\nLest My fury go forth like fire\nAnd burn so that no one can quench it,\nBecause of the evil of your doings.\n“Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley,\nAnd rock of the plain,” says the LORD,\n“Who say, ‘Who shall come down against us?\nOr who shall enter our dwellings?’\nBut I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings,” says the LORD;\n“I will kindle a fire in its forest,\nAnd it shall devour all things around it.” ’ ”",

Thus says the LORD: “Execute judgment and righteousness, and deliver the plundered out of the hand of the oppressor. Do no wrong and do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, or the widow, nor shed innocent blood in this place. For if you indeed do this thing, then shall enter the gates of this house, riding on horses and in chariots, accompanied by servants and people, kings who sit on the throne of David. But if you will not hear these words, I swear by Myself,” says the LORD, “that this house shall become a desolation.” ’ ”\nFor thus says the LORD to the house of the king of Judah:\n“You are Gilead to Me,\nThe head of Lebanon;\nYet I surely will make you a wilderness,\nCities which are not inhabited.\nI will prepare destroyers against you,\nEveryone with his weapons;\nThey shall cut down your choice cedars\nAnd cast them into the fire.\nAnd many nations will pass by this city; and everyone will say to his neighbor, ‘Why has the LORD done so to this great city?’ Then they will answer, ‘Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshiped other gods and served them.’ ”\nWeep not for the dead, nor bemoan him;\nWeep bitterly for him who goes away,\nFor he shall return no more,\nNor see his native country.\n\nFor thus says the LORD concerning Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, who went from this place: “He shall not return here anymore, but he shall die in the place where they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more.\n“Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness\nAnd his chambers by injustice,\nWho uses his neighbor’s service without wages\nAnd gives him nothing for his work,\nWho says, ‘I will build myself a wide house with spacious chambers,\nAnd cut out windows for it,\nPaneling it with cedar\nAnd painting it with vermilion.’\n“Shall you reign because you enclose yourself in cedar?\nDid not your father eat and drink,\nAnd do justice and righteousness?\nThen it was well with him.\nHe judged the cause of the poor and needy;\nThen it was well.\nWas not this knowing Me?” says the LORD.\n“Yet your eyes and your heart are for nothing but your covetousness,\nFor shedding innocent blood,\nAnd practicing oppression and violence.”\nTherefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:\n“They shall not lament for him,\nSaying, ‘Alas, my brother!’ or ‘Alas, my sister!’\nThey shall not lament for him,\nSaying, ‘Alas, master!’ or ‘Alas, his glory!’\nHe shall be buried with the burial of a donkey,\nDragged and cast out beyond the gates of Jerusalem.\n“Go up to Lebanon, and cry out,\nAnd lift up your voice in Bashan;\nCry from Abarim,\nFor all your lovers are destroyed.\nI spoke to you in your prosperity,\nBut you said, ‘I will not hear.’\nThis has been your manner from your youth,\nThat you did not obey My voice.\nThe wind shall eat up all your rulers,\nAnd your lovers shall go into captivity;\nSurely then you will be ashamed and humiliated\nFor all your wickedness.\nO inhabitant of Lebanon,\nMaking your nest in the cedars,\nHow gracious will you be when pangs come upon you,\nLike the pain of a woman in labor?\n\n“As I live,” says the LORD, “though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were the signet on My right hand, yet I would pluck you off; and I will give you into the hand of those who seek your life, and into the hand of those whose face you fear—the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the hand of the Chaldeans. So I will cast you out, and your mother who bore you, into another country where you were not born; and there you shall die. But to the land to which they desire to return, there they shall not return.\n“Is this man Coniah a despised, broken idol—\nA vessel in which is no pleasure?\nWhy are they cast out, he and his descendants,\nAnd cast into a land which they do not know?\nO earth, earth, earth,\nHear the word of the LORD!\nThus says the LORD:\n‘Write this man down as childless,\nA man who shall not prosper in his days;\nFor none of his descendants shall prosper,\nSitting on the throne of David,\nAnd ruling anymore in Judah.’ ”",

      "chapter_text": "“Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of My pasture!” says the LORD. Therefore thus says the LORD God of Israel against the shepherds who feed My people: “You have scattered My flock, driven them away, and not attended to them. Behold, I will attend to you for the evil of your doings,” says the LORD. “But I will gather the remnant of My flock out of all countries where I have driven them, and bring them back to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase. I will set up shepherds over them who will feed them; and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, nor shall they be lacking,” says the LORD.\n“Behold, the days are coming,” says the LORD,\n“That I will raise to David a Branch of righteousness;\nA King shall reign and prosper,\nAnd execute judgment and righteousness in the earth.\nIn His days Judah will be saved,\nAnd Israel will dwell safely;\nNow this is His name by which He will be called:\nTHE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.\n“Therefore, behold, the days are coming,” says the LORD, “that they shall no longer say, ‘As the LORD lives who brought up the children of Israel from the land of Egypt,’ but, ‘As the LORD lives who brought up and led the descendants of the house of Israel from the north country and from all the countries where I had driven them.’ And they shall dwell in their own land.”\n\nMy heart within me is broken\nBecause of the prophets;\nAll my bones shake.\nI am like a drunken man,\nAnd like a man whom wine has overcome,\nBecause of the LORD,\nAnd because of His holy words.\nFor the land is full of adulterers;\nFor because of a curse the land mourns.\nThe pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up.\nTheir course of life is evil,\nAnd their might is not right.\n“For both prophet and priest are profane;\nYes, in My house I have found their wickedness,” says the LORD.\n“Therefore their way shall be to them\nLike slippery ways;\nIn the darkness they shall be driven on\nAnd fall in them;\nFor I will bring disaster on them,\nThe year of their punishment,” says the LORD.\n“And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria:\nThey prophesied by Baal\nAnd caused My people Israel to err.\nAlso I have seen a horrible thing in the prophets of Jerusalem:\nThey commit adultery and walk in lies;\nThey also strengthen the hands of evildoers,\nSo that no one turns back from his wickedness.\nAll of them are like Sodom to Me,\nAnd her inhabitants like Gomorrah.\n“Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets:\n‘Behold, I will feed them with wormwood,\nAnd make them drink the water of gall;\nFor from the prophets of Jerusalem\nProfaneness has gone out into all the land.’ ”\nThus says the LORD of hosts:\n“Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you.\nThey make you worthless;\nThey speak a vision of their own heart,\nNot from the mouth of the LORD.\nThey continually say to those who despise Me,\n‘The LORD has said, “You shall have peace” ’;\nAnd to everyone who walks according to the dictates of his own heart, they say,\n‘No evil shall come upon you.’ ”\nFor who has stood in the counsel of the LORD,\nAnd has perceived and heard His word?\nWho has marked His word and heard it?\nBehold, a whirlwind of the LORD has gone forth in fury—\nA violent whirlwind!\nIt will fall violently on the head of the wicked.\nThe anger of the LORD will not turn back\nUntil He has executed and performed the thoughts of His heart.\nIn the latter days you will understand it perfectly.\n“I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran.\nI have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.\nBut if they had stood in My counsel,\nAnd had caused My people to hear My words,\nThen they would have turned them from their evil way\nAnd from the evil of their doings.\n“Am I a God near at hand,” says the LORD,\n“And not a God afar off?\nCan anyone hide himself in secret places,\nSo I shall not see him?” says the LORD;\n“Do I not fill heaven and earth?” says the LORD.\n“I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy lies in My name, saying, ‘I have dreamed, I have dreamed!’ How long will this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies? Indeed they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart, who try to make My people forget My name by their dreams which everyone tells his neighbor, as their fathers forgot My name for Baal.\n“The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream;\nAnd he who has My word, let him speak My word faithfully.\nWhat is the chaff to the wheat?” says the LORD.\n“Is not My word like a fire?” says the LORD,\n“And like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?\n“Therefore behold, I am against the prophets,” says the LORD, “who steal My words every one from his neighbor. Behold, I am against the prophets,” says the LORD, “who use their tongues and say, ‘He says.’ Behold, I am against those who prophesy false dreams,” says the LORD, “and tell them, and cause My people to err by their lies and by their recklessness. Yet I did not send them or command them; therefore they shall not profit this people at all,” says the LORD.\n“So when these people or the prophet or the priest ask you, saying, ‘What is the oracle of the LORD?’ you shall then say to them, ‘What oracle?’ I will even forsake you,” says the LORD. “And as for the prophet and the priest and the people who say, ‘The oracle of the LORD!’ I will even punish that man and his house. Thus every one of you shall say to his neighbor, and every one to his brother, ‘What has the LORD answered?’ and, ‘What has the LORD spoken?’ And the oracle of the LORD you shall mention no more. For every man’s word will be his oracle, for you have perverted the words of the living God, the LORD of hosts, our God. Thus you shall say to the prophet, ‘What has the LORD answered you?’ and, ‘What has the LORD spoken?’ But since you say, ‘The oracle of the LORD!’ therefore thus says the LORD: ‘Because you say this word, “The oracle of the LORD!” and I have sent to you, saying, “Do not say, ‘The oracle of the LORD!’ ” therefore behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you and forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, and will cast you out of My presence. And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.’ ”",

One basket had very good figs, like the figs that are first ripe; and the other basket had very bad figs which could not be eaten, they were so bad. Then the LORD said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?”\nAnd I said, “Figs, the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad.”\nAgain the word of the LORD came to me, saying, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: ‘Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge those who are carried away captive from Judah, whom I have sent out of this place for their own good, into the land of the Chaldeans. For I will set My eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this land; I will build them and not pull them down, and I will plant them and not pluck them up. Then I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am the LORD; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God, for they shall return to Me with their whole heart.\n‘And as the bad figs which cannot be eaten, they are so bad’—surely thus says the LORD—‘so will I give up Zedekiah the king of Judah, his princes, the residue of Jerusalem who remain in this land, and those who dwell in the land of Egypt. I will deliver them to trouble into all the kingdoms of the earth, for their harm, to be a reproach and a byword, a taunt and a curse, in all places where I shall drive them.

And the LORD has sent to you all His servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, but you have not listened nor inclined your ear to hear. They said, ‘Repent now everyone of his evil way and his evil doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD has given to you and your fathers forever and ever. Do not go after other gods to serve them and worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands; and I will not harm you.’ Yet you have not listened to Me,” says the LORD, “that you might provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt.\n“Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: ‘Because you have not heard My words, behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,’ says the LORD, ‘and Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant, and will bring them against this land, against its inhabitants, and against these nations all around, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, a hissing, and perpetual desolations. Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp. And this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment, and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.\n‘Then it will come to pass, when seventy years are completed, that I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their iniquity,’ says the LORD; ‘and I will make it a perpetual desolation. So I will bring on that land all My words which I have pronounced against it, all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied concerning all the nations. (For many nations and great kings shall be served by them also; and I will repay them according to their deeds and according to the works of their own hands.)’ ”\n\nFor thus says the LORD God of Israel to me: “Take this wine cup of fury from My hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it. And they will drink and stagger and go mad because of the sword that I will send among them.”\nThen I took the cup from the LORD’s hand, and made all the nations drink, to whom the LORD had sent me: Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, its kings and its princes, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day; Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his princes, and all his people; all the mixed multitude, all the kings of the land of Uz, all the kings of the land of the Philistines (namely, Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod); Edom, Moab, and the people of Ammon; all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the coastlands which are across the sea; Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who are in the farthest corners; all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the mixed multitude who dwell in the desert; all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes; all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world which are on the face of the earth. Also the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.\n“Therefore you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: “Drink, be drunk, and vomit! Fall and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.” ’ And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts: “You shall certainly drink! For behold, I begin to bring calamity on the city which is called by My name, and should you be utterly unpunished? You shall not be unpunished, for I will call for a sword on all the inhabitants of the earth,” says the LORD of hosts.’\n“Therefore prophesy against them all these words, and say to them:\n‘The LORD will roar from on high,\nAnd utter His voice from His holy habitation;\nHe will roar mightily against His fold.\nHe will give a shout, as those who tread the grapes,\nAgainst all the inhabitants of the earth.\nA noise will come to the ends of the earth—\nFor the LORD has a controversy with the nations;\nHe will plead His case with all flesh.\nHe will give those who are wicked to the sword,’ says the LORD.”\nThus says the LORD of hosts:\n“Behold, disaster shall go forth\nFrom nation to nation,\nAnd a great whirlwind shall be raised up\nFrom the farthest parts of the earth.\nAnd at that day the slain of the LORD shall be from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth. They shall not be lamented, or gathered, or buried; they shall become refuse on the ground.\n“Wail, shepherds, and cry!\nRoll about in the ashes,\nYou leaders of the flock!\nFor the days of your slaughter and your dispersions are fulfilled;\nYou shall fall like a precious vessel.\nAnd the shepherds will have no way to flee,\nNor the leaders of the flock to escape.\nA voice of the cry of the shepherds,\nAnd a wailing of the leaders to the flock will be heard.\nFor the LORD has plundered their pasture,\nAnd the peaceful dwellings are cut down\nBecause of the fierce anger of the LORD.\nHe has left His lair like the lion;\nFor their land is desolate\nBecause of the fierceness of the Oppressor,\nAnd because of His fierce anger.”",

      "chapter_text": "In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the LORD, saying, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Stand in the court of the LORD’s house, and speak to all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD’s house, all the words that I command you to speak to them. Do not diminish a word. Perhaps everyone will listen and turn from his evil way, that I may relent concerning the calamity which I purpose to bring on them because of the evil of their doings.’ And you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD: “If you will not listen to Me, to walk in My law which I have set before you, to heed the words of My servants the prophets whom I sent to you, both rising up early and sending them (but you have not heeded), then I will make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.” ’ ”\nSo the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD. Now it happened, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak to all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him, saying, “You will surely die! Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, ‘This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate, without an inhabitant’?” And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.\nWhen the princes of Judah heard these things, they came up from the king’s house to the house of the LORD and sat down in the entry of the New Gate of the LORD’s house. And the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and all the people, saying, “This man deserves to die! For he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your ears.”\nThen Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and all the people, saying: “The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city with all the words that you have heard. Now therefore, amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; then the LORD will relent concerning the doom that He has pronounced against you. As for me, here I am, in your hand; do with me as seems good and proper to you. But know for certain that if you put me to death, you will surely bring innocent blood on yourselves, on this city, and on its inhabitants; for truly the LORD has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing.”\nSo the princes and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, “This man does not deserve to die. For he has spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God.”\nThen certain of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying: “Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts:\n“Zion shall be plowed like a field,\nJerusalem shall become heaps of ruins,\nAnd the mountain of the temple\nLike the bare hills of the forest.” ’\nDid Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah ever put him to death? Did he not fear the LORD and seek the LORD’s favor? And the LORD relented concerning the doom which He had pronounced against them. But we are doing great evil against ourselves.”\nNow there was also a man who prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath Jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah. And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death; but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid and fled, and went to Egypt. Then Jehoiakim the king sent men to Egypt: Elnathan the son of Achbor, and other men who went with him to Egypt. And they brought Urijah from Egypt and brought him to Jehoiakim the king, who killed him with the sword and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.\nNevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, so that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.",

And command them to say to their masters, “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel—thus you shall say to your masters: ‘I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are on the ground, by My great power and by My outstretched arm, and have given it to whom it seemed proper to Me. And now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant; and the beasts of the field I have also given him to serve him. So all nations shall serve him and his son and his son’s son, until the time of his land comes; and then many nations and great kings shall make him serve them. And it shall be, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and which will not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation I will punish,’ says the LORD, ‘with the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand. Therefore do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your soothsayers, or your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, “You shall not serve the king of Babylon.” For they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land; and I will drive you out, and you will perish. But the nations that bring their necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will let them remain in their own land,’ says the LORD, ‘and they shall till it and dwell in it.’ ” ’ ”\nI also spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, “Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live! Why will you die, you and your people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD has spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? Therefore do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying, ‘You shall not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they prophesy a lie to you; for I have not sent them,” says the LORD, “yet they prophesy a lie in My name, that I may drive you out, and that you may perish, you and the prophets who prophesy to you.”\nAlso I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying, “Behold, the vessels of the LORD’s house will now shortly be brought back from Babylon”; for they prophesy a lie to you.

But if they are prophets, and if the word of the LORD is with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, do not go to Babylon.’\n“For thus says the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, concerning the Sea, concerning the carts, and concerning the remainder of the vessels that remain in this city, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem— yes, thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem: ‘They shall be carried to Babylon, and there they shall be until the day that I visit them,’ says the LORD. ‘Then I will bring them up and restore them to this place.’ ”",

Within two full years I will bring back to this place all the vessels of the LORD’s house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon. And I will bring back to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah who went to Babylon,’ says the LORD, ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’ ”\nThen the prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people who stood in the house of the LORD, and the prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen! The LORD do so; the LORD perform your words which you have prophesied, to bring back the vessels of the LORD’s house and all who were carried away captive, from Babylon to this place. Nevertheless hear now this word that I speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people: The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many countries and great kingdoms—of war and disaster and pestilence. As for the prophet who prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet comes to pass, the prophet will be known as one whom the LORD has truly sent.”\nThen Hananiah the prophet took the yoke off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck and broke it. And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Even so I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years.’ ” And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.\nNow the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying, “Go and tell Hananiah, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD: “You have broken the yokes of wood, but you have made in their place yokes of iron.” For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: “I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him. I have given him the beasts of the field also.” ’ ”\nThen the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, “Hear now, Hananiah, the LORD has not sent you, but you make this people trust in a lie. Therefore thus says the LORD: ‘Behold, I will cast you from the face of the earth. This year you shall die, because you have taught rebellion against the LORD.’ ”\nSo Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.",

(This happened after Jeconiah the king, the queen mother, the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem.) The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, saying,\nThus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all who were carried away captive, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon:\nBuild houses and dwell in them; plant gardens and eat their fruit. Take wives and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands, so that they may bear sons and daughters—that you may be increased there, and not diminished. And seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive, and pray to the LORD for it; for in its peace you will have peace. For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Do not let your prophets and your diviners who are in your midst deceive you, nor listen to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed. For they prophesy falsely to you in My name; I have not sent them, says the LORD.\nFor thus says the LORD: After seventy years are completed at Babylon, I will visit you and perform My good word toward you, and cause you to return to this place. For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the LORD, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope. Then you will call upon Me and go and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart. I will be found by you, says the LORD, and I will bring you back from your captivity; I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places where I have driven you, says the LORD, and I will bring you to the place from which I cause you to be carried away captive.\nBecause you have said, “The LORD has raised up prophets for us in Babylon”— therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king who sits on the throne of David, concerning all the people who dwell in this city, and concerning your brethren who have not gone out with you into captivity— thus says the LORD of hosts: Behold, I will send on them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like rotten figs that cannot be eaten, they are so bad. And I will pursue them with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence; and I will deliver them to trouble among all the kingdoms of the earth—to be a curse, an astonishment, a hissing, and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them, because they have not heeded My words, says the LORD, which I sent to them by My servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them; neither would you heed, says the LORD. Therefore hear the word of the LORD, all you of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon.\nThus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in My name: Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall slay them before your eyes. And because of them a curse shall be taken up by all the captivity of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, “The LORD make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire”; because they have done disgraceful things in Israel, have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and have spoken lying words in My name, which I have not commanded them. Indeed I know, and am a witness, says the LORD.\nYou shall also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying, Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying: You have sent letters in your name to all the people who are at Jerusalem, to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying, “The LORD has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, so that there should be officers in the house of the LORD over every man who is demented and considers himself a prophet, that you should put him in prison and in the stocks. Now therefore, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who makes himself a prophet to you? For he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, ‘This captivity is long; build houses and dwell in them, and plant gardens and eat their fruit.’ ”\nNow Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet. Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying: Send to all those in captivity, saying, Thus says the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, and I have not sent him, and he has caused you to trust in a lie— therefore thus says the LORD: Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his family: he shall not have anyone to dwell among this people, nor shall he see the good that I will do for My people, says the LORD, because he has taught rebellion against the LORD.",

For that day is great,\nSo that none is like it;\nAnd it is the time of Jacob’s trouble,\nBut he shall be saved out of it.\n‘For it shall come to pass in that day,’\nSays the LORD of hosts,\n‘That I will break his yoke from your neck,\nAnd will burst your bonds;\nForeigners shall no more enslave them.\nBut they shall serve the LORD their God,\nAnd David their king,\nWhom I will raise up for them.\n‘Therefore do not fear, O My servant Jacob,’ says the LORD,\n‘Nor be dismayed, O Israel;\nFor behold, I will save you from afar,\nAnd your seed from the land of their captivity.\nJacob shall return, have rest and be quiet,\nAnd no one shall make him afraid.\nFor I am with you,’ says the LORD, ‘to save you;\nThough I make a full end of all nations where I have scattered you,\nYet I will not make a complete end of you.\nBut I will correct you in justice,\nAnd will not let you go altogether unpunished.’\n“For thus says the LORD:\n‘Your affliction is incurable,\nYour wound is severe.\nThere is no one to plead your cause,\nThat you may be bound up;\nYou have no healing medicines.\nAll your lovers have forgotten you;\nThey do not seek you;\nFor I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy,\nWith the chastisement of a cruel one,\nFor the multitude of your iniquities,\nBecause your sins have increased.\nWhy do you cry about your affliction?\nYour sorrow is incurable.\nBecause of the multitude of your iniquities,\nBecause your sins have increased,\nI have done these things to you.\n‘Therefore all those who devour you shall be devoured;\nAnd all your adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity;\nThose who plunder you shall become plunder,\nAnd all who prey upon you I will make a prey.\nFor I will restore health to you\nAnd heal you of your wounds,’ says the LORD,\n‘Because they called you an outcast saying:\n“This is Zion;\nNo one seeks her.” ’\n“Thus says the LORD:\n‘Behold, I will bring back the captivity of Jacob’s tents,\nAnd have mercy on his dwelling places;\nThe city shall be built upon its own mound,\nAnd the palace shall remain according to its own plan.\nThen out of them shall proceed thanksgiving\nAnd the voice of those who make merry;\nI will multiply them, and they shall not diminish;\nI will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.\nTheir children also shall be as before,\nAnd their congregation shall be established before Me;\nAnd I will punish all who oppress them.\nTheir nobles shall be from among them,\nAnd their governor shall come from their midst;\nThen I will cause him to draw near,\nAnd he shall approach Me;\nFor who is this who pledged his heart to approach Me?’ says the LORD.\n‘You shall be My people,\nAnd I will be your God.’ ”\nBehold, the whirlwind of the LORD\nGoes forth with fury,\nA continuing whirlwind;\nIt will fall violently on the head of the wicked.\nThe fierce anger of the LORD will not return until He has done it,\nAnd until He has performed the intents of His heart.\nIn the latter days you will consider it.",

For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.”\nAfter this I awoke and looked around, and my sleep was sweet to me.\n“Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and the seed of beast. And it shall come to pass, that as I have watched over them to pluck up, to break down, to throw down, to destroy, and to afflict, so I will watch over them to build and to plant, says the LORD. In those days they shall say no more:\n‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes,\nAnd the children’s teeth are set on edge.’\nBut every one shall die for his own iniquity; every man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.\n\n“Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah— not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, though I was a husband to them, says the LORD. But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD: I will put My law in their minds, and write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people. No more shall every man teach his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, ‘Know the LORD,’ for they all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says the LORD. For I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.”\nThus says the LORD,\nWho gives the sun for a light by day,\nThe ordinances of the moon and the stars for a light by night,\nWho disturbs the sea,\nAnd its waves roar\n(The LORD of hosts is His name):\n“If those ordinances depart\nFrom before Me, says the LORD,\nThen the seed of Israel shall also cease\nFrom being a nation before Me forever.”\nThus says the LORD:\n“If heaven above can be measured,\nAnd the foundations of the earth searched out beneath,\nI will also cast off all the seed of Israel\nFor all that they have done, says the LORD.\n“Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, that the city shall be built for the LORD from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. The surveyor’s line shall again extend straight forward over the hill Gareb; then it shall turn toward Goath. And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields as far as the Brook Kidron, to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east, shall be holy to the LORD. It shall not be plucked up or thrown down anymore forever.”",

      "chapter_text": "The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. For then the king of Babylon’s army besieged Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah’s house. For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, “Why do you prophesy and say, ‘Thus says the LORD: “Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it; and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him face to face, and see him eye to eye; then he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there he shall be until I visit him,” says the LORD; “though you fight with the Chaldeans, you shall not succeed” ’?”\nAnd Jeremiah said, “The word of the LORD came to me, saying, ‘Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you, saying, “Buy my field which is in Anathoth, for the right of redemption is yours to buy it.” ’ Then Hanamel my uncle’s son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said to me, ‘Please buy my field that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is yours, and the redemption yours; buy it for yourself.’ Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD. So I bought the field from Hanamel, the son of my uncle who was in Anathoth, and weighed out to him the money—seventeen shekels of silver. And I signed the deed and sealed it, took witnesses, and weighed the money on the scales. So I took the purchase deed, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open; and I gave the purchase deed to Baruch the son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel my uncle’s son, and in the presence of the witnesses who signed the purchase deed, before all the Jews who sat in the court of the prison.\n“Then I charged Baruch before them, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: “Take these deeds, both this purchase deed which is sealed and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may last many days.” For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: “Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.” ’\n\n“Now when I had delivered the purchase deed to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD, saying: ‘Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. There is nothing too hard for You. You show lovingkindness to thousands, and repay the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them—the Great, the Mighty God, whose name is the LORD of hosts. You are great in counsel and mighty in work, for Your eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of men, to give everyone according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings. You have set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, to this day, and in Israel and among other men; and You have made Yourself a name, as it is this day. You have brought Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terror; You have given them this land, of which You swore to their fathers to give them—“a land flowing with milk and honey.” And they came in and took possession of it, but they have not obeyed Your voice or walked in Your law. They have done nothing of all that You commanded them to do; therefore You have caused all this calamity to come upon them.\n‘Look, the siege mounds! They have come to the city to take it; and the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword and famine and pestilence. What You have spoken has happened; there You see it! And You have said to me, O Lord GOD, “Buy the field for money, and take witnesses”!—yet the city has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’ ”\n\nThen the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, “Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh. Is there anything too hard for Me? Therefore thus says the LORD: ‘Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it. And the Chaldeans who fight against this city shall come and set fire to this city and burn it, with the houses on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal and poured out drink offerings to other gods, to provoke Me to anger; because the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only evil before Me from their youth. For the children of Israel have provoked Me only to anger with the work of their hands,’ says the LORD. ‘For this city has been to Me a provocation of My anger and My fury from the day that they built it, even to this day; so I will remove it from before My face because of all the evil of the children of Israel and the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke Me to anger—they, their kings, their princes, their priests, their prophets, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And they have turned to Me the back, and not the face; though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not listened to receive instruction. But they set their abominations in the house which is called by My name, to defile it. And they built the high places of Baal which are in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech, which I did not command them, nor did it come into My mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.’\n“Now therefore, thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, ‘It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence’: Behold, I will gather them out of all countries where I have driven them in My anger, in My fury, and in great wrath; I will bring them back to this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely. They shall be My people, and I will be their God; then I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear Me forever, for the good of them and their children after them. And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from doing them good; but I will put My fear in their hearts so that they will not depart from Me. Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will assuredly plant them in this land, with all My heart and with all My soul.’\n“For thus says the LORD: ‘Just as I have brought all this great calamity on this people, so I will bring on them all the good that I have promised them. And fields will be bought in this land of which you say, “It is desolate, without man or beast; it has been given into the hand of the Chaldeans.” Men will buy fields for money, sign deeds and seal them, and take witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem, in the cities of Judah, in the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South; for I will cause their captives to return,’ says the LORD.”",

Behold, I will bring it health and healing; I will heal them and reveal to them the abundance of peace and truth. And I will cause the captives of Judah and the captives of Israel to return, and will rebuild those places as at the first. I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against Me, and I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned and by which they have transgressed against Me. Then it shall be to Me a name of joy, a praise, and an honor before all nations of the earth, who shall hear all the good that I do to them; they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and all the prosperity that I provide for it.’\n“Thus says the LORD: ‘Again there shall be heard in this place—of which you say, “It is desolate, without man and without beast”—in the cities of Judah, in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without beast, the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who will say:\n“Praise the LORD of hosts,\nFor the LORD is good,\nFor His mercy endures forever”—\nand of those who will bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause the captives of the land to return as at the first,’ says the LORD.\n“Thus says the LORD of hosts: ‘In this place which is desolate, without man and without beast, and in all its cities, there shall again be a dwelling place of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down. In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the lowland, in the cities of the South, in the land of Benjamin, in the places around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, the flocks shall again pass under the hands of him who counts them,’ says the LORD.\n‘Behold, the days are coming,’ says the LORD, ‘that I will perform that good thing which I have promised to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah:\n‘In those days and at that time\nI will cause to grow up to David\nA Branch of righteousness;\nHe shall execute judgment and righteousness in the earth.\nIn those days Judah will be saved,\nAnd Jerusalem will dwell safely.\nAnd this is the name by which she will be called:\nTHE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.’\n“For thus says the LORD: ‘David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel; nor shall the priests, the Levites, lack a man to offer burnt offerings before Me, to kindle grain offerings, and to sacrifice continually.’ ”\n\nAnd the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, “Thus says the LORD: ‘If you can break My covenant with the day and My covenant with the night, so that there will not be day and night in their season, then My covenant may also be broken with David My servant, so that he shall not have a son to reign on his throne, and with the Levites, the priests, My ministers. As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, nor the sand of the sea measured, so will I multiply the descendants of David My servant and the Levites who minister to Me.’ ”\nMoreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, “Have you not considered what these people have spoken, saying, ‘The two families which the LORD has chosen, He has also cast them off’? Thus they have despised My people, as if they should no more be a nation before them.\n“Thus says the LORD: ‘If My covenant is not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth, then I will cast away the descendants of Jacob and David My servant, so that I will not take any of his descendants to be rulers over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will cause their captives to return, and will have mercy on them.’ ”",

And you shall not escape from his hand, but shall surely be taken and delivered into his hand; your eyes shall see the eyes of the king of Babylon, he shall speak with you face to face, and you shall go to Babylon.’ ” ’ Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah! Thus says the LORD concerning you: ‘You shall not die by the sword. You shall die in peace; as in the ceremonies of your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so they shall burn incense for you and lament for you, saying, “Alas, lord!” For I have pronounced the word, says the LORD.’ ”\nThen Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem, when the king of Babylon’s army fought against Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish and Azekah; for only these fortified cities remained of the cities of Judah.\n\nThis is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem to proclaim liberty to them: that every man should set free his male and female slave—a Hebrew man or woman—that no one should keep a Jewish brother in bondage. Now when all the princes and all the people, who had entered into the covenant, heard that everyone should set free his male and female slaves, that no one should keep them in bondage anymore, they obeyed and let them go. But afterward they changed their minds and made the male and female slaves return, whom they had set free, and brought them into subjection as male and female slaves.\nTherefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: ‘I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying, “At the end of seven years let every man set free his Hebrew brother, who has been sold to him; and when he has served you six years, you shall let him go free from you.” But your fathers did not obey Me nor incline their ear. Then you recently turned and did what was right in My sight—every man proclaiming liberty to his neighbor; and you made a covenant before Me in the house which is called by My name. Then you turned around and profaned My name, and every one of you brought back his male and female slaves, whom you had set at liberty, at their pleasure, and brought them back into subjection, to be your male and female slaves.’\n“Therefore thus says the LORD: ‘You have not obeyed Me in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother and every one to his neighbor. Behold, I proclaim liberty to you,’ says the LORD—‘to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine! And I will deliver you to trouble among all the kingdoms of the earth. And I will give the men who have transgressed My covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before Me, when they cut the calf in two and passed between the parts of it— the princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf— I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their life. Their dead bodies shall be for meat for the birds of the heaven and the beasts of the earth. And I will give Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes into the hand of their enemies, into the hand of those who seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army which has gone back from you. Behold, I will command,’ says the LORD, ‘and cause them to return to this city. They will fight against it and take it and burn it with fire; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant.’ ”",

Then I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, “Drink wine.”\nBut they said, “We will drink no wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, ‘You shall drink no wine, you nor your sons, forever. You shall not build a house, sow seed, plant a vineyard, nor have any of these; but all your days you shall dwell in tents, that you may live many days in the land where you are sojourners.’ Thus we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters, nor to build ourselves houses to dwell in; nor do we have vineyard, field, or seed. But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us. But it came to pass, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, ‘Come, let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans and for fear of the army of the Syrians.’ So we dwell at Jerusalem.”\nThen came the word of the LORD to Jeremiah, saying, “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, “Will you not receive instruction to obey My words?” says the LORD. “The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, which he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed; for to this day they drink none, and obey their father’s commandment. But although I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking, you did not obey Me. I have also sent to you all My servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, ‘Turn now everyone from his evil way, amend your doings, and do not go after other gods to serve them; then you will dwell in the land which I have given you and your fathers.’ But you have not inclined your ear, nor obeyed Me. Surely the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them, but this people has not obeyed Me.” ’\n“Therefore thus says the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Behold, I will bring on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the doom that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken to them but they have not heard, and I have called to them but they have not answered.’ ”\nAnd Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts and done according to all that he commanded you, therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: “Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not lack a man to stand before Me forever.” ’ ”",

      "chapter_text": "Now it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying: “Take a scroll of a book and write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel, against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah even to this day. It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the adversities which I purpose to bring upon them, that everyone may turn from his evil way, that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.”\nThen Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah; and Baruch wrote on a scroll of a book, at the instruction of Jeremiah, all the words of the LORD which He had spoken to him. And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, “I am confined, I cannot go into the house of the LORD. You go, therefore, and read from the scroll which you have written at my instruction, the words of the LORD, in the hearing of the people in the LORD’s house on the day of fasting. And you shall also read them in the hearing of all Judah who come from their cities. It may be that they will present their supplication before the LORD, and everyone will turn from his evil way. For great is the anger and the fury that the LORD has pronounced against this people.” And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading from the book the words of the LORD in the LORD’s house.\nNow it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem. Then Baruch read from the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper court at the entry of the New Gate of the LORD’s house, in the hearing of all the people.\n\nWhen Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the LORD from the book, he then went down to the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber; and there all the princes were sitting—Elishama the scribe, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes. Then Michaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read the book in the hearing of the people. Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, “Take in your hand the scroll from which you have read in the hearing of the people, and come.” So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them. And they said to him, “Sit down now, and read it in our hearing.” So Baruch read it in their hearing.\nNow it happened, when they had heard all the words, that they looked in fear from one to another, and said to Baruch, “We will surely tell the king of all these words.” And they asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us now, how did you write all these words—at his instruction?”\nSo Baruch answered them, “He proclaimed with his mouth all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink in the book.”\nThen the princes said to Baruch, “Go and hide, you and Jeremiah; and let no one know where you are.”\n\nAnd they went to the king, into the court; but they stored the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the hearing of the king. So the king sent Jehudi to bring the scroll, and he took it from Elishama the scribe’s chamber. And Jehudi read it in the hearing of the king and in the hearing of all the princes who stood beside the king. Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month, with a fire burning on the hearth before him. And it happened, when Jehudi had read three or four columns, that the king cut it with the scribe’s knife and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth. Yet they were not afraid, nor did they tear their garments, the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words. Nevertheless Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah implored the king not to burn the scroll; but he would not listen to them. And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but the LORD hid them.\n\nNow after the king had burned the scroll with the words which Baruch had written at the instruction of Jeremiah, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying: “Take yet another scroll, and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned. And you shall say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, ‘Thus says the LORD: “You have burned this scroll, saying, ‘Why have you written in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and cause man and beast to cease from here?’ ” Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: “He shall have no one to sit on the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat of the day and the frost of the night. I will punish him, his family, and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring on them, on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah all the doom that I have pronounced against them; but they did not heed.” ’ ”\nThen Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote on it at the instruction of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And besides, there were added to them many similar words.",

But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land gave heed to the words of the LORD which He spoke by the prophet Jeremiah.\nAnd Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, “Pray now to the LORD our God for us.” Now Jeremiah was coming and going among the people, for they had not yet put him in prison. Then Pharaoh’s army came up from Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they departed from Jerusalem.\nThen the word of the LORD came to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘Thus you shall say to the king of Judah, who sent you to Me to inquire of Me: “Behold, Pharaoh’s army which has come up to help you will return to Egypt, to their own land. And the Chaldeans shall come back and fight against this city, and take it and burn it with fire.” ’ Thus says the LORD: ‘Do not deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans will surely depart from us,” for they will not depart. For though you had defeated the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you, and there remained only wounded men among them, they would rise up, every man in his tent, and burn the city with fire.’ ”\n\nAnd it happened, when the army of the Chaldeans left the siege of Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army, that Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin to claim his property there among the people. And when he was in the Gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard was there whose name was Irijah the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are defecting to the Chaldeans!”\nThen Jeremiah said, “False! I am not defecting to the Chaldeans.” But he did not listen to him.\nSo Irijah seized Jeremiah and brought him to the princes. Therefore the princes were angry with Jeremiah, and they struck him and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe. For they had made that the prison.\nWhen Jeremiah entered the dungeon and the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days, then Zedekiah the king sent and took him out. The king asked him secretly in his house, and said, “Is there any word from the LORD?”\nAnd Jeremiah said, “There is.” Then he said, “You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon!”\nMoreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “What offense have I committed against you, against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison? Where now are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land’? Therefore please hear now, O my lord the king. Please, let my petition be accepted before you, and do not make me return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.”\nThen Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah to the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread from the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city was gone. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.",

For this man does not seek the welfare of this people, but their harm.”\nThen Zedekiah the king said, “Look, he is in your hand. For the king can do nothing against you.” So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the king’s son, which was in the court of the prison, and they let Jeremiah down with ropes. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire. So Jeremiah sank in the mire.\nNow Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs, who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon. When the king was sitting at the Gate of Benjamin, Ebed-Melech went out of the king’s house and spoke to the king, saying: “My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon, and he is likely to die from hunger in the place where he is. For there is no more bread in the city.” Then the king commanded Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian, saying, “Take from here thirty men with you, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon before he dies.” So Ebed-Melech took the men with him and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took from there old clothes and old rags, and let them down by ropes into the dungeon to Jeremiah. Then Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Please put these old clothes and rags under your armpits, under the ropes.” And Jeremiah did so. So they pulled Jeremiah up with ropes and lifted him out of the dungeon. And Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.\n\nThen Zedekiah the king sent and had Jeremiah the prophet brought to him at the third entrance of the house of the LORD. And the king said to Jeremiah, “I will ask you something. Hide nothing from me.”\nJeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? And if I give you advice, you will not listen to me.”\nSo Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, “As the LORD lives, who made our very souls, I will not put you to death, nor will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life.”\nThen Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘If you surely surrender to the king of Babylon’s princes, then your soul shall live; this city shall not be burned with fire, and you and your house shall live. But if you do not surrender to the king of Babylon’s princes, then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans; they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape from their hand.’ ”\nAnd Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have defected to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they abuse me.”\nBut Jeremiah said, “They shall not deliver you. Please, obey the voice of the LORD which I speak to you. So it shall be well with you, and your soul shall live. But if you refuse to surrender, this is the word that the LORD has shown me: ‘Now behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah’s house shall be surrendered to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those women shall say:\n“Your close friends have set upon you\nAnd prevailed against you;\nYour feet have sunk in the mire,\nAnd they have turned away again.”\n‘So they shall surrender all your wives and children to the Chaldeans. You shall not escape from their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon. And you shall cause this city to be burned with fire.’ ”\nThen Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no one know of these words, and you shall not die. But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you and say to you, ‘Declare to us now what you have said to the king, and also what the king said to you; do not hide it from us, and we will not put you to death,’ then you shall say to them, ‘I presented my request before the king, that he would not make me return to Jonathan’s house to die there.’ ”\nThen all the princes came to Jeremiah and asked him. And he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they stopped speaking with him, for the conversation had not been heard. Now Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken. And he was there when Jerusalem was taken.",

In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the city was penetrated.\nThen all the princes of the king of Babylon came in and sat in the Middle Gate: Nergal-Sharezer, Samgar-Nebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal-Sarezer, Rabmag, with the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.\nSo it was, when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, that they fled and went out of the city by night, by way of the king’s garden, by the gate between the two walls. And he went out by way of the plain. But the Chaldean army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And when they had captured him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced judgment on him. Then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes in Riblah; the king of Babylon also killed all the nobles of Judah. Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him with bronze fetters to carry him off to Babylon. And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house and the houses of the people with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive to Babylon the remnant of the people who remained in the city and those who defected to him, with the rest of the people who remained. But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left in the land of Judah the poor people, who had nothing, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.\n\nNow Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying, “Take him and look after him, and do him no harm; but do to him just as he says to you.” So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent Nebushasban, Rabsaris, Nergal-Sharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon’s chief officers; then they sent someone to take Jeremiah from the court of the prison, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, that he should take him home. So he dwelt among the people.\nMeanwhile the word of the LORD had come to Jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying, “Go and speak to Ebed-Melech the Ethiopian, saying, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: “Behold, I will bring My words upon this city for adversity and not for good, and they shall be performed in that day before you. But I will deliver you in that day,” says the LORD, “and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid. For I will surely deliver you, and you shall not fall by the sword; but your life shall be as a prize to you, because you have put your trust in Me,” says the LORD.’ ”",

Now the LORD has brought it, and has done just as He said. Because you people have sinned against the LORD, and not obeyed His voice, therefore this thing has come upon you. And now look, I free you this day from the chains that were on your hand. If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you. But if it seems wrong for you to come with me to Babylon, remain here. See, all the land is before you; wherever it seems good and convenient for you to go, go there.”\nNow while Jeremiah had not yet gone back, Nebuzaradan said, “Go back to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people. Or go wherever it seems convenient for you to go.” So the captain of the guard gave him rations and a gift and let him go. Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, to Mizpah, and dwelt with him among the people who were left in the land.\nAnd when all the captains of the armies who were in the fields, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, women, children, and the poorest of the land who had not been carried away captive to Babylon, then they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men. And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, took an oath before them and their men, saying, “Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. As for me, I will indeed dwell at Mizpah and serve the Chaldeans who come to us. But you, gather wine and summer fruit and oil, put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.” Likewise, when all the Jews who were in Moab, among the Ammonites, in Edom, and who were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, then all the Jews returned out of all places where they had been driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruit in abundance.\nMoreover Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and said to him, “Do you certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to murder you?” But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam did not believe them.\nThen Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah in Mizpah, saying, “Let me go, please, and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he murder you, so that all the Jews who are gathered to you would be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?”\nBut Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You shall not do this thing, for you speak falsely concerning Ishmael.”",

      "chapter_text": "Now it came to pass in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family and of the officers of the king, came with ten men to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at Mizpah. And there they ate bread together in Mizpah. Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men who were with him, arose and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword, and killed him whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land. Ishmael also struck down all the Jews who were with him, that is, with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war.\nAnd it happened, on the second day after he had killed Gedaliah, when as yet no one knew it, that certain men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, eighty men with their beards shaved and their clothes torn, having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD. Now Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went along; and it happened as he met them that he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam!” So it was, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them and cast them into the midst of a pit, he and the men who were with him. But ten men were found among them who said to Ishmael, “Do not kill us, for we have treasures of wheat, barley, oil, and honey in the field.” So he desisted and did not kill them among their brethren. Now the pit into which Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain, because of Gedaliah, was the same one Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain. Then Ishmael carried away captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, the king’s daughters and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive and departed to go over to the Ammonites.\nBut when Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done, they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah; and they found him by the great pool that is in Gibeon. So it was, when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, that they were glad. Then all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah. But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to the Ammonites.\nThen Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, took from Mizpah all the rest of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah after he had murdered Gedaliah the son of Ahikam—the mighty men of war and the women and the children and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon. And they departed and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is near Bethlehem, as they went on their way to Egypt, because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had murdered Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had made governor in the land.",

Indeed, I will pray to the LORD your God according to your words, and it shall be, that whatever the LORD answers you, I will declare it to you. I will keep nothing back from you.”\nSo they said to Jeremiah, “Let the LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not do according to everything which the LORD your God sends us by you. Whether it is pleasing or displeasing, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God to whom we send you, that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.”\nAnd it happened after ten days that the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah. Then he called Johanan the son of Kareah, all the captains of the forces which were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, and said to them, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your petition before Him: ‘If you will still remain in this land, then I will build you and not pull you down, and I will plant you and not pluck you up. For I relent concerning the disaster that I have brought upon you. Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid; do not be afraid of him,’ says the LORD, ‘for I am with you, to save you and deliver you from his hand. And I will show you mercy, that he may have mercy on you and cause you to return to your own land.’\n“But if you say, ‘We will not dwell in this land,’ disobeying the voice of the LORD your God, saying, ‘No, but we will go to the land of Egypt where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor be hungry for bread, and there we will dwell’— Then hear now the word of the LORD, O remnant of Judah! Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘If you wholly set your faces to enter Egypt, and go to dwell there, then it shall be that the sword which you feared shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; the famine of which you were afraid shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there you shall die. So shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go to Egypt to dwell there. They shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence. And none of them shall remain or escape from the disaster that I will bring upon them.’\n“For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘As My anger and My fury have been poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so will My fury be poured out on you when you enter Egypt. And you shall be an oath, an astonishment, a curse, and a reproach; and you shall see this place no more.’\n“The LORD has said concerning you, O remnant of Judah, ‘Do not go to Egypt!’ Know certainly that I have admonished you this day. For you were hypocrites in your hearts when you sent me to the LORD your God, saying, ‘Pray for us to the LORD our God, and according to all that the LORD your God says, so declare to us and we will do it.’ And I have this day declared it to you, but you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, or anything which He has sent you by me. Now therefore, know certainly that you shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence in the place where you desire to go to dwell.”",

The LORD our God has not sent you to say, ‘Do not go to Egypt to dwell there.’ But Baruch the son of Neriah has set you against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death or carry us away captive to Babylon.” So Johanan the son of Kareah, all the captains of the forces, and all the people would not obey the voice of the LORD, to remain in the land of Judah. But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the remnant of Judah who had returned to dwell in the land of Judah, from all nations where they had been driven— men, women, children, the king’s daughters, and every person whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah. So they went to the land of Egypt, for they did not obey the voice of the LORD. And they went as far as Tahpanhes.\nThen the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, “Take large stones in your hand, and hide them in the sight of the men of Judah, in the clay in the brick courtyard which is at the entrance to Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes; and say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: “Behold, I will send and bring Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, My servant, and will set his throne above these stones that I have hidden. And he will spread his royal pavilion over them. When he comes, he shall strike the land of Egypt and deliver to death those appointed for death, and to captivity those appointed for captivity, and to the sword those appointed for the sword. I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt, and he shall burn them and carry them away captive. And he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd puts on his garment, and he shall go out from there in peace. He shall also break the sacred pillars of Beth Shemesh that are in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians he shall burn with fire.” ’ ”",

      "chapter_text": "The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who dwell in the land of Egypt, who dwell at Migdol, at Tahpanhes, at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying, “Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘You have seen all the calamity that I have brought on Jerusalem and on all the cities of Judah; and behold, this day they are a desolation, and no one dwells in them, because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke Me to anger, in that they went to burn incense and to serve other gods whom they did not know, they nor you nor your fathers. However I have sent to you all My servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, “Oh, do not do this abominable thing that I hate!” But they did not listen or incline their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense to other gods. So My fury and My anger were poured out and kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as it is this day.’\n“Now therefore, thus says the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Why do you commit this great evil against yourselves, to cut off from you man and woman, child and infant, out of Judah, leaving none to remain, in that you provoke Me to wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have gone to dwell, that you may cut yourselves off and be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth? Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of the kings of Judah, the wickedness of their wives, your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? They have not been humbled, to this day, nor have they feared; they have not walked in My law or in My statutes that I set before you and your fathers.’\n“Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: ‘Behold, I will set My face against you for catastrophe and for cutting off all Judah. And I will take the remnant of Judah who have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to dwell there, and they shall all be consumed and fall in the land of Egypt. They shall be consumed by the sword and by famine. They shall die, from the least to the greatest, by the sword and by famine; and they shall be an oath, an astonishment, a curse and a reproach! For I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, so that none of the remnant of Judah who have gone into the land of Egypt to dwell there shall escape or survive, lest they return to the land of Judah, to which they desire to return and dwell. For none shall return except those who escape.’ ”\nThen all the men who knew that their wives had burned incense to other gods, with all the women who stood by, a great multitude, and all the people who dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying: “As for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we will not listen to you! But we will certainly do whatever has gone out of our own mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. For then we had plenty of food, were well-off, and saw no trouble. But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have been consumed by the sword and by famine.”\nThe women also said, “And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, did we make cakes for her, to worship her, and pour out drink offerings to her without our husbands’ permission?”\nThen Jeremiah spoke to all the people—the men, the women, and all the people who had given him that answer—saying: “The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and did it not come into His mind? So the LORD could no longer bear it, because of the evil of your doings and because of the abominations which you committed. Therefore your land is a desolation, an astonishment, a curse, and without an inhabitant, as it is this day. Because you have burned incense and because you have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD or walked in His law, in His statutes or in His testimonies, therefore this calamity has happened to you, as at this day.”\nMoreover Jeremiah said to all the people and to all the women, “Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt! Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying: ‘You and your wives have spoken with your mouths and fulfilled with your hands, saying, “We will surely keep our vows that we have made, to burn incense to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her.” You will surely keep your vows and perform your vows!’ Therefore hear the word of the LORD, all Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt: ‘Behold, I have sworn by My great name,’ says the LORD, ‘that My name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, “The Lord GOD lives.” Behold, I will watch over them for adversity and not for good. And all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by famine, until there is an end to them. Yet a small number who escape the sword shall return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah; and all the remnant of Judah, who have gone to the land of Egypt to dwell there, shall know whose words will stand, Mine or theirs. And this shall be a sign to you,’ says the LORD, ‘that I will punish you in this place, that you may know that My words will surely stand against you for adversity.’\n“Thus says the LORD: ‘Behold, I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of those who seek his life, as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, his enemy who sought his life.’ ”",

And I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the hand of his servants. Afterward it shall be inhabited as in the days of old,” says the LORD.\n\n“But do not fear, O My servant Jacob,\nAnd do not be dismayed, O Israel!\nFor behold, I will save you from afar,\nAnd your offspring from the land of their captivity;\nJacob shall return, have rest and be at ease;\nNo one shall make him afraid.\nDo not fear, O Jacob My servant,” says the LORD,\n“For I am with you;\nFor I will make a complete end of all the nations\nTo which I have driven you,\nBut I will not make a complete end of you.\nI will rightly correct you,\nFor I will not leave you wholly unpunished.”",

I will weep for you with the weeping of Jazer.\nYour plants have gone over the sea,\nThey reach to the sea of Jazer.\nThe plunderer has fallen on your summer fruit and your vintage.\nJoy and gladness are taken\nFrom the plentiful field\nAnd from the land of Moab;\nI have caused wine to fail from the winepresses;\nNo one will tread with joyous shouting—\nNot joyous shouting!\n“From the cry of Heshbon to Elealeh and to Jahaz\nThey have uttered their voice,\nFrom Zoar to Horonaim,\nLike a three-year-old heifer;\nFor the waters of Nimrim also shall be desolate.\n“Moreover,” says the LORD,\n“I will cause to cease in Moab\nThe one who offers sacrifices in the high places\nAnd burns incense to his gods.\nTherefore My heart shall wail like flutes for Moab,\nAnd like flutes My heart shall wail\nFor the men of Kir Heres.\nTherefore the riches they have acquired have perished.\n“For every head shall be bald, and every beard clipped;\nOn all the hands shall be cuts, and on the loins sackcloth—\nA general lamentation\nOn all the housetops of Moab,\nAnd in its streets;\nFor I have broken Moab like a vessel in which is no pleasure,” says the LORD.\n“They shall wail:\n‘How she is broken down!\nHow Moab has turned her back with shame!’\nSo Moab shall be a derision\nAnd a dismay to all those about her.”\nFor thus says the LORD:\n“Behold, one shall fly like an eagle,\nAnd spread his wings over Moab.\nKerioth is taken,\nAnd the strongholds are surprised;\nThe mighty men’s hearts in Moab on that day shall be\nLike the heart of a woman in birth pangs.\nAnd Moab shall be destroyed as a people,\nBecause he exalted himself against the LORD.\nFear and the pit and the snare shall be upon you,\nO inhabitant of Moab,” says the LORD.\n“He who flees from the fear shall fall into the pit,\nAnd he who gets out of the pit shall be caught in the snare.\nFor upon Moab, upon it I will bring\nThe year of their punishment,” says the LORD.\n“Those who fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon\nBecause of exhaustion.\nBut a fire shall come out of Heshbon,\nA flame from the midst of Sihon,\nAnd shall devour the brow of Moab,\nThe crown of the head of the sons of tumult.\nWoe to you, O Moab!\nThe people of Chemosh perish;\nFor your sons have been taken captive,\nAnd your daughters captive.\n“Yet I will bring back the captives of Moab\nIn the latter days,” says the LORD.\nThus far is the judgment of Moab.",

And are you the one who will altogether go unpunished? You shall not go unpunished, but you shall surely drink of it.

And all its cities shall be perpetual wastes.”\nI have heard a message from the LORD,\nAnd an ambassador has been sent to the nations:\n“Gather together, come against her,\nAnd rise up to battle!\n“For indeed, I will make you small among nations,\nDespised among men.\nYour fierceness has deceived you,\nThe pride of your heart,\nO you who dwell in the clefts of the rock,\nWho hold the height of the hill!\nThough you make your nest as high as the eagle,\nI will bring you down from there,” says the LORD.\n“Edom also shall be an astonishment;\nEveryone who goes by it will be astonished\nAnd will hiss at all its plagues.\nAs in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah\nAnd their neighbors,” says the LORD,\n“No one shall remain there,\nNor shall a son of man dwell in it.\n“Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the floodplain of the Jordan\nAgainst the dwelling place of the strong;\nBut I will suddenly make him run away from her.\nAnd who is a chosen man that I may appoint over her?\nFor who is like Me?\nWho will arraign Me?\nAnd who is that shepherd\nWho will withstand Me?”\nTherefore hear the counsel of the LORD that He has taken against Edom,\nAnd His purposes that He has proposed against the inhabitants of Teman:\nSurely the least of the flock shall draw them out;\nSurely He shall make their dwelling places desolate with them.\nThe earth shakes at the noise of their fall;\nAt the cry its noise is heard at the Red Sea.\nBehold, He shall come up and fly like the eagle,\nAnd spread His wings over Bozrah;\nThe heart of the mighty men of Edom in that day shall be\nLike the heart of a woman in birth pangs.\n\nAgainst Damascus.\n“Hamath and Arpad are shamed,\nFor they have heard bad news.\nThey are fainthearted;\nThere is trouble on the sea;\nIt cannot be quiet.\nDamascus has grown feeble;\nShe turns to flee,\nAnd fear has seized her.\nAnguish and sorrows have taken her like a woman in labor.\nWhy is the city of praise not deserted, the city of My joy?\nTherefore her young men shall fall in her streets,\nAnd all the men of war shall be cut off in that day,” says the LORD of hosts.\n“I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus,\nAnd it shall consume the palaces of Ben-Hadad.”\n\nAgainst Kedar and against the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon shall strike.\nThus says the LORD:\n“Arise, go up to Kedar,\nAnd devastate the men of the East!\nTheir tents and their flocks they shall take away.\nThey shall take for themselves their curtains,\nAll their vessels and their camels;\nAnd they shall cry out to them,\n‘Fear is on every side!’\n“Flee, get far away! Dwell in the depths,\nO inhabitants of Hazor!” says the LORD.\n“For Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has taken counsel against you,\nAnd has conceived a plan against you.\n“Arise, go up to the wealthy nation that dwells securely,” says the LORD,\n“Which has neither gates nor bars,\nDwelling alone.\nTheir camels shall be for booty,\nAnd the multitude of their cattle for plunder.\nI will scatter to all winds those in the farthest corners,\nAnd I will bring their calamity from all its sides,” says the LORD.\n“Hazor shall be a dwelling for jackals, a desolation forever;\nNo one shall reside there,\nNor son of man dwell in it.”\n\nThe word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying, “Thus says the LORD of hosts:\n‘Behold, I will break the bow of Elam,\nThe foremost of their might.\nAgainst Elam I will bring the four winds\nFrom the four quarters of heaven,\nAnd scatter them toward all those winds;\nThere shall be no nations where the outcasts of Elam will not go.\nFor I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies\nAnd before those who seek their life.\nI will bring disaster upon them,\nMy fierce anger,’ says the LORD;\n‘And I will send the sword after them\nUntil I have consumed them.\nI will set My throne in Elam,\nAnd will destroy from there the king and the princes,’ says the LORD.\n‘But it shall come to pass in the latter days:\nI will bring back the captives of Elam,’ says the LORD.”",

standard;\nProclaim—do not conceal it—\nSay, ‘Babylon is taken, Bel is shamed.\nMerodach is broken in pieces;\nHer idols are humiliated,\nHer images are broken in pieces.’\nFor out of the north a nation comes up against her,\nWhich shall make her land desolate,\nAnd no one shall dwell therein.\nThey shall move, they shall depart,\nBoth man and beast.\n“In those days and in that time,” says the LORD,\n“The children of Israel shall come,\nThey and the children of Judah together;\nWith continual weeping they shall come,\nAnd seek the LORD their God.\nThey shall ask the way to Zion,\nWith their faces toward it, saying,\n‘Come and let us join ourselves to the LORD\nIn a perpetual covenant\nThat will not be forgotten.’\n“My people have been lost sheep.\nTheir shepherds have led them astray;\nThey have turned them away on the mountains.\nThey have gone from mountain to hill;\nThey have forgotten their resting place.\nAll who found them have devoured them;\nAnd their adversaries said, ‘We have not offended,\nBecause they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice,\nThe LORD, the hope of their fathers.’\n“Move from the midst of Babylon,\nGo out of the land of the Chaldeans;\nAnd be like the rams before the flocks.\nFor behold, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon\nAn assembly of great nations from the north country,\nAnd they shall array themselves against her;\nFrom there she shall be captured.\nTheir arrows shall be like those of an expert warrior;\nNone shall return in vain.\nAnd Chaldea shall become plunder;\nAll who plunder her shall be satisfied,” says the LORD.\n“Because you were glad, because you rejoiced,\nYou destroyers of My heritage,\nBecause you have grown fat like a heifer threshing grain,\nAnd you bellow like bulls,\nYour mother shall be deeply ashamed;\nShe who bore you shall be ashamed.\nBehold, the least of the nations shall be a wilderness,\nA dry land and a desert.\nBecause of the wrath of the LORD\nShe shall not be inhabited,\nBut she shall be wholly desolate.\nEveryone who goes by Babylon shall be horrified\nAnd hiss at all her plagues.\n“Put yourselves in array against Babylon all around,\nAll you who bend the bow;\nShoot at her, spare no arrows,\nFor she has sinned against the LORD.\nShout against her all around;\nShe has given her hand,\nHer foundations have fallen,\nHer walls are thrown down;\nFor it is the vengeance of the LORD.\nTake vengeance on her.\nAs she has done, so do to her.\nCut off the sower from Babylon,\nAnd him who handles the sickle at harvest time.\nFor fear of the oppressing sword\nEveryone shall turn to his own people,\nAnd everyone shall flee to his own land.\n“Israel is like scattered sheep;\nThe lions have driven him away.\nFirst the king of Assyria devoured him;\nNow at last this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has broken his bones.”\nTherefore thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel:\n“Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land,\nAs I have punished the king of Assyria.\nBut I will bring back Israel to his home,\nAnd he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan;\nHis soul shall be satisfied on Mount Ephraim and Gilead.\nIn those days and in that time,” says the LORD,\n“The iniquity of Israel shall be sought, but there shall be none;\nAnd the sins of Judah, but they shall not be found;\nFor I will pardon those whom I preserve.\n“Go up against the land of Merathaim, against it,\nAnd against the inhabitants of Pekod.\nWaste and utterly destroy them,” says the LORD,\n“And do according to all that I have commanded you.\nA sound of battle is in the land,\nAnd of great destruction.\nHow the hammer of the whole earth has been cut apart and broken!\nHow Babylon has become a desolation among the nations!\nI have laid a snare for you;\nYou have indeed been trapped, O Babylon,\nAnd you were not aware;\nYou have been found and also caught,\nBecause you have contended against the LORD.\nThe LORD has opened His armory,\nAnd has brought out the weapons of His indignation;\nFor this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts\nIn the land of the Chaldeans.\nCome against her from the farthest border;\nOpen her storehouses;\nCast her up as heaps of ruins,\nAnd destroy her utterly;\nLet nothing of her be left.\nSlay all her bulls,\nLet them go down to the slaughter.\nWoe to them!\nFor their day has come, the time of their punishment.\nThe voice of those who flee and escape from the land of Babylon\nDeclares in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God,\nThe vengeance of His temple.\n“Call together the archers against Babylon.\nAll you who bend the bow, encamp against it all around;\nLet none of them escape.\nRepay her according to her work;\nAccording to all she has done, do to her;\nFor she has been proud against the LORD,\nAgainst the Holy One of Israel.\nTherefore her young men shall fall in the streets,\nAnd all her men of war shall be cut off in that day,” says the LORD.\n“Behold, I am against you,\nO most haughty one!” says the Lord GOD of hosts;\n“For your day has come,\nThe time that I will punish you.\nThe most proud shall stumble and fall,\nAnd no one will raise him up;\nI will kindle a fire in his cities,\nAnd it will devour all around him.”\nThus says the LORD of hosts:\n“The children of Israel were oppressed,\nAlong with the children of Judah;\nAll who took them captive have held them fast;\nThey have refused to let them go.\nTheir Redeemer is strong;\nThe LORD of hosts is His name.\nHe will thoroughly plead their case,\nThat He may give rest to the land,\nAnd disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.\n“A sword is against the Chaldeans,” says the LORD,\n“Against the inhabitants of Babylon,\nAnd against her princes and her wise men.\nA sword is against the soothsayers, and they will be fools.\nA sword is against her mighty men, and they will be dismayed.\nA sword is against their horses,\nAgainst their chariots,\nAnd against all the mixed peoples who are in her midst;\nAnd they will become like women.\nA sword is against her treasures, and they will be robbed.\nA drought is against her waters, and they will be dried up.\nFor it is the land of carved images,\nAnd they are insane with their idols.\n“Therefore the wild desert beasts shall dwell there with the jackals,\nAnd the ostriches shall dwell in it.\nIt shall be inhabited no more forever,\nNor shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.\nAs God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah\nAnd their neighbors,” says the LORD,\n“So no one shall reside there,\nNor son of man dwell in it.\n“Behold, a people shall come from the north,\nAnd a great nation and many kings\nShall be raised up from the ends of the earth.\nThey shall hold the bow and the lance;\nThey are cruel and shall not show mercy.\nTheir voice shall roar like the sea;\nThey shall ride on horses,\nSet in array, like a man for the battle,\nAgainst you, O daughter of Babylon.\n“The king of Babylon has heard the report about them,\nAnd his hands grow feeble;\nAnguish has taken hold of him,\nPangs as of a woman in childbirth.\n“Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the floodplain of the Jordan\nAgainst the dwelling place of the strong;\nBut I will make them suddenly run away from her.\nAnd who is a chosen man that I may appoint over her?\nFor who is like Me?\nWho will arraign Me?\nAnd who is that shepherd\nWho will withstand Me?”\nTherefore hear the counsel of the LORD that He has taken against Babylon,\nAnd His purposes that He has proposed against the land of the Chaldeans:\nSurely the least of the flock shall draw them out;\nSurely He will make their dwelling place desolate with them.\nAt the noise of the taking of Babylon\nThe earth trembles,\nAnd the cry is heard among the nations.",

winnow her and empty her land.\nFor in the day of doom\nThey shall be against her all around.\nAgainst her let the archer bend his bow,\nAnd lift himself up against her in his armor.\nDo not spare her young men;\nUtterly destroy all her army.\nThus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans,\nAnd those thrust through in her streets.\nFor Israel is not forsaken, nor Judah,\nBy his God, the LORD of hosts,\nThough their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.”\nFlee from the midst of Babylon,\nAnd every one save his life!\nDo not be cut off in her iniquity,\nFor this is the time of the LORD’s vengeance;\nHe shall recompense her.\nBabylon was a golden cup in the LORD’s hand,\nThat made all the earth drunk.\nThe nations drank her wine;\nTherefore the nations are deranged.\nBabylon has suddenly fallen and been destroyed.\nWail for her!\nTake balm for her pain;\nPerhaps she may be healed.\nWe would have healed Babylon,\nBut she is not healed.\nForsake her, and let us go everyone to his own country;\nFor her judgment reaches to heaven and is lifted up to the skies.\nThe LORD has revealed our righteousness.\nCome and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God.\nMake the arrows bright!\nGather the shields!\nThe LORD has raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes.\nFor His plan is against Babylon to destroy it,\nBecause it is the vengeance of the LORD,\nThe vengeance for His temple.\nSet up the standard on the walls of Babylon;\nMake the guard strong,\nSet up the watchmen,\nPrepare the ambushes.\nFor the LORD has both devised and done\nWhat He spoke against the inhabitants of Babylon.\nO you who dwell by many waters,\nAbundant in treasures,\nYour end has come,\nThe measure of your covetousness.\nThe LORD of hosts has sworn by Himself:\n“Surely I will fill you with men, as with locusts,\nAnd they shall lift up a shout against you.”\nHe has made the earth by His power;\nHe has established the world by His wisdom,\nAnd stretched out the heaven by His understanding.\nWhen He utters His voice—\nThere is a multitude of waters in the heavens:\n“He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth;\nHe makes lightnings for the rain;\nHe brings the wind out of His treasuries.”\nEveryone is dull-hearted, without knowledge;\nEvery metalsmith is put to shame by the carved image;\nFor his molded image is falsehood,\nAnd there is no breath in them.\nThey are futile, a work of errors;\nIn the time of their punishment they shall perish.\nThe Portion of Jacob is not like them,\nFor He is the Maker of all things;\nAnd Israel is the tribe of His inheritance.\nThe LORD of hosts is His name.\n“You are My battle-ax and weapons of war:\nFor with you I will break the nation in pieces;\nWith you I will destroy kingdoms;\nWith you I will break in pieces the horse and its rider;\nWith you I will break in pieces the chariot and its rider;\nWith you also I will break in pieces man and woman;\nWith you I will break in pieces old and young;\nWith you I will break in pieces the young man and the maiden;\nWith you also I will break in pieces the shepherd and his flock;\nWith you I will break in pieces the farmer and his yoke of oxen;\nAnd with you I will break in pieces governors and rulers.\n“And I will repay Babylon\nAnd all the inhabitants of Chaldea\nFor all the evil they have done\nIn Zion in your sight,” says the LORD.\n“Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain,\nWho destroys all the earth,” says the LORD.\n“And I will stretch out My hand against you,\nRoll you down from the rocks,\nAnd make you a burnt mountain.\nThey shall not take from you a stone for a corner\nNor a stone for a foundation,\nBut you shall be desolate forever,” says the LORD.\nSet up a banner in the land,\nBlow the trumpet among the nations!\nPrepare the nations against her,\nCall the kingdoms together against her:\nArarat, Minni, and Ashkenaz.\nAppoint a general against her;\nCause the horses to come up like the bristling locusts.\nPrepare against her the nations,\nWith the kings of the Medes,\nIts governors and all its rulers,\nAll the land of his dominion.\nAnd the land will tremble and sorrow;\nFor every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon,\nTo make the land of Babylon a desolation without inhabitant.\nThe mighty men of Babylon have ceased fighting,\nThey have remained in their strongholds;\nTheir might has failed,\nThey became like women;\nThey have burned her dwelling places,\nThe bars of her gate are broken.\nOne runner will run to meet another,\nAnd one messenger to meet another,\nTo show the king of Babylon that his city is taken on all sides;\nThe passages are blocked,\nThe reeds they have burned with fire,\nAnd the men of war are terrified.\nFor thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel:\n“The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor\nWhen it is time to thresh her;\nYet a little while\nAnd the time of her harvest will come.”\n“Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon\nHas devoured me, he has crushed me;\nHe has made me an empty vessel,\nHe has swallowed me up like a monster;\nHe has filled his stomach with my delicacies,\nHe has spit me out.\nLet the violence done to me and my flesh be upon Babylon,”\nThe inhabitant of Zion will say;\n“And my blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea!”\nJerusalem will say.\nTherefore thus says the LORD:\n“Behold, I will plead your case and take vengeance for you.\nI will dry up her sea and make her springs dry.\nBabylon shall become a heap,\nA dwelling place for jackals,\nAn astonishment and a hissing,\nWithout an inhabitant.\nThey shall roar together like lions,\nThey shall growl like lions’ whelps.\nIn their excitement I will prepare their feasts;\nI will make them drunk,\nThat they may rejoice,\nAnd sleep a perpetual sleep\nAnd not awake,” says the LORD.\n“I will bring them down\nLike lambs to the slaughter,\nLike rams with male goats.\n“Oh, how Sheshach is taken!\nOh, how the praise of the whole earth is seized!\nHow Babylon has become desolate among the nations!\nThe sea has come up over Babylon;\nShe is covered with the multitude of its waves.\nHer cities are a desolation,\nA dry land and a wilderness,\nA land where no one dwells,\nThrough which no son of man passes.\nI will punish Bel in Babylon,\nAnd I will bring out of his mouth what he has swallowed;\nAnd the nations shall not stream to him anymore.\nYes, the wall of Babylon shall fall.\n“My people, go out of the midst of her!\nAnd let everyone deliver himself from the fierce anger of the LORD.\nAnd lest your heart faint,\nAnd you fear for the rumor that will be heard in the land\n(A rumor will come one year,\nAnd after that, in another year\nA rumor will come,\nAnd violence in the land,\nRuler against ruler),\nTherefore behold, the days are coming\nThat I will bring judgment on the carved images of Babylon;\nHer whole land shall be ashamed,\nAnd all her slain shall fall in her midst.\nThen the heavens and the earth and all that is in them\nShall sing joyously over Babylon;\nFor the plunderers shall come to her from the north,” says the LORD.\nAs Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall,\nSo at Babylon the slain of all the earth shall fall.\nYou who have escaped the sword,\nGet away! Do not stand still!\nRemember the LORD afar off,\nAnd let Jerusalem come to your mind.\nWe are ashamed because we have heard reproach.\nShame has covered our faces,\nFor strangers have come into the sanctuaries of the LORD’s house.\n“Therefore behold, the days are coming,” says the LORD,\n“That I will bring judgment on her carved images,\nAnd throughout all her land the wounded shall groan.\nThough Babylon were to mount up to heaven,\nAnd though she were to fortify the height of her strength,\nYet from Me plunderers would come to her,” says the LORD.\nThe sound of a cry comes from Babylon,\nAnd great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans,\nBecause the LORD is plundering Babylon\nAnd silencing her loud voice,\nThough her waves roar like great waters,\nAnd the noise of their voice is uttered,\nBecause the plunderer comes against her, against Babylon,\nAnd her mighty men are taken.\nEvery one of their bows is broken;\nFor the LORD is the God of recompense,\nHe will surely repay.\n“And I will make drunk\nHer princes and wise men,\nHer governors, her deputies, and her mighty men.\nAnd they shall sleep a perpetual sleep\nAnd not awake,” says the King,\nWhose name is the LORD of hosts.\nThus says the LORD of hosts:\n“The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken,\nAnd her high gates shall be burned with fire;\nThe people will labor in vain,\nAnd the nations, because of the fire;\nAnd they shall be weary.”\n\nThe word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And Seraiah was the quartermaster. So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that would come upon Babylon, all these words that are written against Babylon. And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “When you arrive in Babylon and see it, and read all these words, then you shall say, ‘O LORD, You have spoken against this place to cut it off, so that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but it shall be desolate forever.’ Now it shall be, when you have finished reading this book, that you shall tie a stone to it and throw it out into the Euphrates. Then you shall say, ‘Thus Babylon shall sink and not rise from the catastrophe that I will bring upon her. And they shall be weary.’ ”\nThus far are the words of Jeremiah.",

      "chapter_text": "Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. He also did evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. For because of the anger of the LORD this happened in Jerusalem and Judah, till He finally cast them out from His presence. Then Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.\nNow it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and encamped against it; and they built a siege wall against it all around. So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. By the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the famine had become so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land. Then the city wall was broken through, and all the men of war fled and went out of the city at night by way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden, even though the Chaldeans were near the city all around. And they went by way of the plain.\nBut the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. All his army was scattered from him. So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he pronounced judgment on him. Then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. And he killed all the princes of Judah in Riblah. He also put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in bronze fetters, took him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.\n\nNow in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month (which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, who served the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. He burned the house of the LORD and the king’s house; all the houses of Jerusalem, that is, all the houses of the great, he burned with fire. And all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around. Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive some of the poor people, the rest of the people who remained in the city, the defectors who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the craftsmen. But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poor of the land as vinedressers and farmers.\nThe bronze pillars that were in the house of the LORD, and the carts and the bronze Sea that were in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried all their bronze to Babylon. They also took away the pots, the shovels, the trimmers, the bowls, the spoons, and all the bronze utensils with which the priests ministered. The basins, the firepans, the bowls, the pots, the lampstands, the spoons, and the cups, whatever was solid gold and whatever was solid silver, the captain of the guard took away. The two pillars, one Sea, the twelve bronze bulls which were under it, and the carts, which King Solomon had made for the house of the LORD—the bronze of all these articles was beyond measure. Now concerning the pillars: the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, a measuring line of twelve cubits could measure its circumference, and its thickness was four fingers; it was hollow. A capital of bronze was on it; and the height of one capital was five cubits, with a network and pomegranates all around the capital, all of bronze. The second pillar, with pomegranates was the same. There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates, all around on the network, were one hundred.\n\nThe captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers. He also took out of the city an officer who had charge of the men of war, seven men of the king’s close associates who were found in the city, the principal scribe of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city. And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took these and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. Then the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive from its own land.\nThese are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews; in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons; in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred and forty-five persons. All the persons were four thousand six hundred.\n\nNow it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, that Evil-Merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison. And he spoke kindly to him and gave him a more prominent seat than those of the kings who were with him in Babylon. So Jehoiachin changed from his prison garments, and he ate bread regularly before the king all the days of his life. And as for his provisions, there was a regular ration given him by the king of Babylon, a portion for each day until the day of his death, all the days of his life.",
