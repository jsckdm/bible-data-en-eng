      "chapter_text": "There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God and shunned evil. And seven sons and three daughters were born to him. Also, his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large household, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the East.\nAnd his sons would go and feast in their houses, each on his appointed day, and would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. So it was, when the days of feasting had run their course, that Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, “It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” Thus Job did regularly.\n\nNow there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them. And the LORD said to Satan, “From where do you come?”\nSo Satan answered the LORD and said, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.”\nThen the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?”\nSo Satan answered the LORD and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing? Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face!”\nAnd the LORD said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your power; only do not lay a hand on his person.”\nSo Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.\n\nNow there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house; and a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them, when the Sabeans raided them and took them away—indeed they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”\nWhile he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”\nWhile he was still speaking, another also came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three bands, raided the camels and took them away, yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”\nWhile he was still speaking, another also came and said, “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, and suddenly a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young people, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you!”\nThen Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head; and he fell to the ground and worshiped. And he said:\n“Naked I came from my mother’s womb,\nAnd naked shall I return there.\nThe LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away;\nBlessed be the name of the LORD.”\nIn all this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong.",

And the LORD said to Satan, “From where do you come?”\nSatan answered the LORD and said, “From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it.”\nThen the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil? And still he holds fast to his integrity, although you incited Me against him, to destroy him without cause.”\nSo Satan answered the LORD and said, “Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life. But stretch out Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will surely curse You to Your face!”\nAnd the LORD said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your hand, but spare his life.”\nSo Satan went out from the presence of the LORD, and struck Job with painful boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. And he took for himself a potsherd with which to scrape himself while he sat in the midst of the ashes.\nThen his wife said to him, “Do you still hold fast to your integrity? Curse God and die!”\nBut he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Shall we indeed accept good from God, and shall we not accept adversity?” In all this Job did not sin with his lips.\n\nNow when Job’s three friends heard of all this adversity that had come upon him, each one came from his own place—Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment together to come and mourn with him, and to comfort him. And when they raised their eyes from afar, and did not recognize him, they lifted their voices and wept; and each one tore his robe and sprinkled dust on his head toward heaven. So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his grief was very great.",

Then the wrath of Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was aroused against Job; his wrath was aroused because he justified himself rather than God. Also against his three friends his wrath was aroused, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.\nNow because they were years older than he, Elihu had waited to speak to Job. When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was aroused.\nSo Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, answered and said:\n“I am young in years, and you are very old;\nTherefore I was afraid,\nAnd dared not declare my opinion to you.\nI said, ‘Age should speak,\nAnd multitude of years should teach wisdom.’\nBut there is a spirit in man,\nAnd the breath of the Almighty gives him understanding.\nGreat men are not always wise,\nNor do the aged always understand justice.\n“Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me,\nI also will declare my opinion.’\nIndeed I waited for your words,\nI listened to your reasonings, while you searched out what to say.\nI paid close attention to you;\nAnd surely not one of you convinced Job,\nOr answered his words—\nLest you say,\n‘We have found wisdom’;\nGod will vanquish him, not man.\nNow he has not directed his words against me;\nSo I will not answer him with your words.\n“They are dismayed and answer no more;\nWords escape them.\nAnd I have waited, because they did not speak,\nBecause they stood still and answered no more.\nI also will answer my part,\nI too will declare my opinion.\nFor I am full of words;\nThe spirit within me compels me.\nIndeed my belly is like wine that has no vent;\nIt is ready to burst like new wineskins.\nI will speak, that I may find relief;\nI must open my lips and answer.\nLet me not, I pray, show partiality to anyone;\nNor let me flatter any man.\nFor I do not know how to flatter,\nElse my Maker would soon take me away.",

Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, go to My servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and My servant Job shall pray for you. For I will accept him, lest I deal with you according to your folly; because you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has.”\nSo Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the LORD commanded them; for the LORD had accepted Job. And the LORD restored Job’s losses when he prayed for his friends. Indeed the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before. Then all his brothers, all his sisters, and all those who had been his acquaintances before, came to him and ate food with him in his house; and they consoled him and comforted him for all the adversity that the LORD had brought upon him. Each one gave him a piece of silver and each a ring of gold.\nNow the LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; for he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and one thousand female donkeys. He also had seven sons and three daughters. And he called the name of the first Jemimah, the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-Happuch. In all the land were found no women so beautiful as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.\nAfter this Job lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his children and grandchildren for four generations. So Job died, old and full of days.",
