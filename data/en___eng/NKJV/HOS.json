Then the LORD said to him:\n“Call his name Jezreel,\nFor in a little while\nI will avenge the bloodshed of Jezreel on the house of Jehu,\nAnd bring an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.\nIt shall come to pass in that day\nThat I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel.”\nAnd she conceived again and bore a daughter. Then God said to him:\n“Call her name Lo-Ruhamah,\nFor I will no longer have mercy on the house of Israel,\nBut I will utterly take them away.\nYet I will have mercy on the house of Judah,\nWill save them by the LORD their God,\nAnd will not save them by bow,\nNor by sword or battle,\nBy horses or horsemen.”\nNow when she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived and bore a son. Then God said:\n“Call his name Lo-Ammi,\nFor you are not My people,\nAnd I will not be your God.\n\n“Yet the number of the children of Israel\nShall be as the sand of the sea,\nWhich cannot be measured or numbered.\nAnd it shall come to pass\nIn the place where it was said to them,\n‘You are not My people,’\nThere it shall be said to them,\n‘You are sons of the living God.’\nThen the children of Judah and the children of Israel\nShall be gathered together,\nAnd appoint for themselves one head;\nAnd they shall come up out of the land,\nFor great will be the day of Jezreel!",
