Get understanding!\nDo not forget, nor turn away from the words of my mouth.\nDo not forsake her, and she will preserve you;\nLove her, and she will keep you.\nWisdom is the principal thing;\nTherefore get wisdom.\nAnd in all your getting, get understanding.\nExalt her, and she will promote you;\nShe will bring you honor, when you embrace her.\nShe will place on your head an ornament of grace;\nA crown of glory she will deliver to you.”\nHear, my son, and receive my sayings,\nAnd the years of your life will be many.\nI have taught you in the way of wisdom;\nI have led you in right paths.\nWhen you walk, your steps will not be hindered,\nAnd when you run, you will not stumble.\nTake firm hold of instruction, do not let go;\nKeep her, for she is your life.\nDo not enter the path of the wicked,\nAnd do not walk in the way of evil.\nAvoid it, do not travel on it;\nTurn away from it and pass on.\nFor they do not sleep unless they have done evil;\nAnd their sleep is taken away unless they make someone fall.\nFor they eat the bread of wickedness,\nAnd drink the wine of violence.\nBut the path of the just is like the shining sun,\nThat shines ever brighter unto the perfect day.\nThe way of the wicked is like darkness;\nThey do not know what makes them stumble.\nMy son, give attention to my words;\nIncline your ear to my sayings.\nDo not let them depart from your eyes;\nKeep them in the midst of your heart;\nFor they are life to those who find them,\nAnd health to all their flesh.\nKeep your heart with all diligence,\nFor out of it spring the issues of life.\nPut away from you a deceitful mouth,\nAnd put perverse lips far from you.\nLet your eyes look straight ahead,\nAnd your eyelids look right before you.\nPonder the path of your feet,\nAnd let all your ways be established.\nDo not turn to the right or the left;\nRemove your foot from evil.",
