And one cried to another and said:\n“Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts;\nThe whole earth is full of His glory!”\nAnd the posts of the door were shaken by the voice of him who cried out, and the house was filled with smoke.\nSo I said:\n“Woe is me, for I am undone!\nBecause I am a man of unclean lips,\nAnd I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips;\nFor my eyes have seen the King,\nThe LORD of hosts.”\nThen one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a live coal which he had taken with the tongs from the altar. And he touched my mouth with it, and said:\n“Behold, this has touched your lips;\nYour iniquity is taken away,\nAnd your sin purged.”\nAlso I heard the voice of the Lord, saying:\n“Whom shall I send,\nAnd who will go for Us?”\nThen I said, “Here am I! Send me.”\nAnd He said, “Go, and tell this people:\n‘Keep on hearing, but do not understand;\nKeep on seeing, but do not perceive.’\n“Make the heart of this people dull,\nAnd their ears heavy,\nAnd shut their eyes;\nLest they see with their eyes,\nAnd hear with their ears,\nAnd understand with their heart,\nAnd return and be healed.”\nThen I said, “Lord, how long?”\nAnd He answered:\n“Until the cities are laid waste and without inhabitant,\nThe houses are without a man,\nThe land is utterly desolate,\nThe LORD has removed men far away,\nAnd the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.\nBut yet a tenth will be in it,\nAnd will return and be for consuming,\nAs a terebinth tree or as an oak,\nWhose stump remains when it is cut down.\nSo the holy seed shall be its stump.”",

And it was told to the house of David, saying, “Syria’s forces are deployed in Ephraim.” So his heart and the heart of his people were moved as the trees of the woods are moved with the wind.\nThen the LORD said to Isaiah, “Go out now to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-Jashub your son, at the end of the aqueduct from the upper pool, on the highway to the Fuller’s Field, and say to him: ‘Take heed, and be quiet; do not fear or be fainthearted for these two stubs of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and the son of Remaliah. Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah have plotted evil against you, saying, “Let us go up against Judah and trouble it, and let us make a gap in its wall for ourselves, and set a king over them, the son of Tabel”—thus says the Lord GOD:\n“It shall not stand,\nNor shall it come to pass.\nFor the head of Syria is Damascus,\nAnd the head of Damascus is Rezin.\nWithin sixty-five years Ephraim will be broken,\nSo that it will not be a people.\nThe head of Ephraim is Samaria,\nAnd the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son.\nIf you will not believe,\nSurely you shall not be established.” ’ ”\n\nMoreover the LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying, “Ask a sign for yourself from the LORD your God; ask it either in the depth or in the height above.”\nBut Ahaz said, “I will not ask, nor will I test the LORD!”\nThen he said, “Hear now, O house of David! Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my God also? Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel. Curds and honey He shall eat, that He may know to refuse the evil and choose the good. For before the Child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land that you dread will be forsaken by both her kings. The LORD will bring the king of Assyria upon you and your people and your father’s house—days that have not come since the day that Ephraim departed from Judah.”\nAnd it shall come to pass in that day\nThat the LORD will whistle for the fly\nThat is in the farthest part of the rivers of Egypt,\nAnd for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.\nThey will come, and all of them will rest\nIn the desolate valleys and in the clefts of the rocks,\nAnd on all thorns and in all pastures.\nIn the same day the Lord will shave with a hired razor,\nWith those from beyond the River, with the king of Assyria,\nThe head and the hair of the legs,\nAnd will also remove the beard.\nIt shall be in that day\nThat a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep;\nSo it shall be, from the abundance of milk they give,\nThat he will eat curds;\nFor curds and honey everyone will eat who is left in the land.\nIt shall happen in that day,\nThat wherever there could be a thousand vines\nWorth a thousand shekels of silver,\nIt will be for briers and thorns.\nWith arrows and bows men will come there,\nBecause all the land will become briers and thorns.\nAnd to any hill which could be dug with the hoe,\nYou will not go there for fear of briers and thorns;\nBut it will become a range for oxen\nAnd a place for sheep to roam.",

And I will take for Myself faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.”\nThen I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the LORD said to me, “Call his name Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz; for before the child shall have knowledge to cry ‘My father’ and ‘My mother,’ the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be taken away before the king of Assyria.”\nThe LORD also spoke to me again, saying:\n“Inasmuch as these people refused\nThe waters of Shiloah that flow softly,\nAnd rejoice in Rezin and in Remaliah’s son;\nNow therefore, behold, the Lord brings up over them\nThe waters of the River, strong and mighty—\nThe king of Assyria and all his glory;\nHe will go up over all his channels\nAnd go over all his banks.\nHe will pass through Judah,\nHe will overflow and pass over,\nHe will reach up to the neck;\nAnd the stretching out of his wings\nWill fill the breadth of Your land, O Immanuel.\n“Be shattered, O you peoples, and be broken in pieces!\nGive ear, all you from far countries.\nGird yourselves, but be broken in pieces;\nGird yourselves, but be broken in pieces.\nTake counsel together, but it will come to nothing;\nSpeak the word, but it will not stand,\nFor God is with us.”\n\nFor the LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying:\n“Do not say, ‘A conspiracy,’\nConcerning all that this people call a conspiracy,\nNor be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled.\nThe LORD of hosts, Him you shall hallow;\nLet Him be your fear,\nAnd let Him be your dread.\nHe will be as a sanctuary,\nBut a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense\nTo both the houses of Israel,\nAs a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.\nAnd many among them shall stumble;\nThey shall fall and be broken,\nBe snared and taken.”\nBind up the testimony,\nSeal the law among my disciples.\nAnd I will wait on the LORD,\nWho hides His face from the house of Jacob;\nAnd I will hope in Him.\nHere am I and the children whom the LORD has given me!\nWe are for signs and wonders in Israel\nFrom the LORD of hosts,\nWho dwells in Mount Zion.\nAnd when they say to you, “Seek those who are mediums and wizards, who whisper and mutter,” should not a people seek their God? Should they seek the dead on behalf of the living? To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.\nThey will pass through it hard-pressed and hungry; and it shall happen, when they are hungry, that they will be enraged and curse their king and their God, and look upward. Then they will look to the earth, and see trouble and darkness, gloom of anguish; and they will be driven into darkness.",

He shall strike you with a rod and lift up his staff against you, in the manner of Egypt. For yet a very little while and the indignation will cease, as will My anger in their destruction.” And the LORD of hosts will stir up a scourge for him like the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb; as His rod was on the sea, so will He lift it up in the manner of Egypt.\nIt shall come to pass in that day\nThat his burden will be taken away from your shoulder,\nAnd his yoke from your neck,\nAnd the yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing oil.\nHe has come to Aiath,\nHe has passed Migron;\nAt Michmash he has attended to his equipment.\nThey have gone along the ridge,\nThey have taken up lodging at Geba.\nRamah is afraid,\nGibeah of Saul has fled.\nLift up your voice,\nO daughter of Gallim!\nCause it to be heard as far as Laish—\nO poor Anathoth!\nMadmenah has fled,\nThe inhabitants of Gebim seek refuge.\nAs yet he will remain at Nob that day;\nHe will shake his fist at the mount of the daughter of Zion,\nThe hill of Jerusalem.\nBehold, the Lord,\nThe LORD of hosts,\nWill lop off the bough with terror;\nThose of high stature will be hewn down,\nAnd the haughty will be humbled.\nHe will cut down the thickets of the forest with iron,\nAnd Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One.",

Cry, O city!\nAll you of Philistia are dissolved;\nFor smoke will come from the north,\nAnd no one will be alone in his appointed times.”\nWhat will they answer the messengers of the nation?\nThat the LORD has founded Zion,\nAnd the poor of His people shall take refuge in it.",

And the land of Judah will be a terror to Egypt; everyone who makes mention of it will be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts which He has determined against it.\n\nIn that day five cities in the land of Egypt will speak the language of Canaan and swear by the LORD of hosts; one will be called the City of Destruction.\nIn that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to the LORD at its border. And it will be for a sign and for a witness to the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt; for they will cry to the LORD because of the oppressors, and He will send them a Savior and a Mighty One, and He will deliver them. Then the LORD will be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know the LORD in that day, and will make sacrifice and offering; yes, they will make a vow to the LORD and perform it. And the LORD will strike Egypt, He will strike and heal it; they will return to the LORD, and He will be entreated by them and heal them.\nIn that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian will come into Egypt and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians will serve with the Assyrians.\nIn that day Israel will be one of three with Egypt and Assyria—a blessing in the midst of the land, whom the LORD of hosts shall bless, saying, “Blessed is Egypt My people, and Assyria the work of My hands, and Israel My inheritance.”",

In that day,’ says the LORD of hosts, ‘the peg that is fastened in the secure place will be removed and be cut down and fall, and the burden that was on it will be cut off; for the LORD has spoken.’ ”",

down to Egypt,\nAnd have not asked My advice,\nTo strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh,\nAnd to trust in the shadow of Egypt!\nTherefore the strength of Pharaoh\nShall be your shame,\nAnd trust in the shadow of Egypt\nShall be your humiliation.\nFor his princes were at Zoan,\nAnd his ambassadors came to Hanes.\nThey were all ashamed of a people who could not benefit them,\nOr be help or benefit,\nBut a shame and also a reproach.”\nThe burden against the beasts of the South.\nThrough a land of trouble and anguish,\nFrom which came the lioness and lion,\nThe viper and fiery flying serpent,\nThey will carry their riches on the backs of young donkeys,\nAnd their treasures on the humps of camels,\nTo a people who shall not profit;\nFor the Egyptians shall help in vain and to no purpose.\nTherefore I have called her\nRahab-Hem-Shebeth.\n\nNow go, write it before them on a tablet,\nAnd note it on a scroll,\nThat it may be for time to come,\nForever and ever:\nThat this is a rebellious people,\nLying children,\nChildren who will not hear the law of the LORD;\nWho say to the seers, “Do not see,”\nAnd to the prophets, “Do not prophesy to us right things;\nSpeak to us smooth things, prophesy deceits.\nGet out of the way,\nTurn aside from the path,\nCause the Holy One of Israel\nTo cease from before us.”\nTherefore thus says the Holy One of Israel:\n“Because you despise this word,\nAnd trust in oppression and perversity,\nAnd rely on them,\nTherefore this iniquity shall be to you\nLike a breach ready to fall,\nA bulge in a high wall,\nWhose breaking comes suddenly, in an instant.\nAnd He shall break it like the breaking of the potter’s vessel,\nWhich is broken in pieces;\nHe shall not spare.\nSo there shall not be found among its fragments\nA shard to take fire from the hearth,\nOr to take water from the cistern.”\nFor thus says the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel:\n“In returning and rest you shall be saved;\nIn quietness and confidence shall be your strength.”\nBut you would not,\nAnd you said, “No, for we will flee on horses”—\nTherefore you shall flee!\nAnd, “We will ride on swift horses”—\nTherefore those who pursue you shall be swift!\nOne thousand shall flee at the threat of one,\nAt the threat of five you shall flee,\nTill you are left as a pole on top of a mountain\nAnd as a banner on a hill.\n\nTherefore the LORD will wait, that He may be gracious to you;\nAnd therefore He will be exalted, that He may have mercy on you.\nFor the LORD is a God of justice;\nBlessed are all those who wait for Him.\nFor the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem;\nYou shall weep no more.\nHe will be very gracious to you at the sound of your cry;\nWhen He hears it, He will answer you.\nAnd though the Lord gives you\nThe bread of adversity and the water of affliction,\nYet your teachers will not be moved into a corner anymore,\nBut your eyes shall see your teachers.\nYour ears shall hear a word behind you, saying,\n“This is the way, walk in it,”\nWhenever you turn to the right hand\nOr whenever you turn to the left.\nYou will also defile the covering of your images of silver,\nAnd the ornament of your molded images of gold.\nYou will throw them away as an unclean thing;\nYou will say to them, “Get away!”\nThen He will give the rain for your seed\nWith which you sow the ground,\nAnd bread of the increase of the earth;\nIt will be fat and plentiful.\nIn that day your cattle will feed\nIn large pastures.\nLikewise the oxen and the young donkeys that work the ground\nWill eat cured fodder,\nWhich has been winnowed with the shovel and fan.\nThere will be on every high mountain\nAnd on every high hill\nRivers and streams of waters,\nIn the day of the great slaughter,\nWhen the towers fall.\nMoreover the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun,\nAnd the light of the sun will be sevenfold,\nAs the light of seven days,\nIn the day that the LORD binds up the bruise of His people\nAnd heals the stroke of their wound.\n\nBehold, the name of the LORD comes from afar,\nBurning with His anger,\nAnd His burden is heavy;\nHis lips are full of indignation,\nAnd His tongue like a devouring fire.\nHis breath is like an overflowing stream,\nWhich reaches up to the neck,\nTo sift the nations with the sieve of futility;\nAnd there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people,\nCausing them to err.\nYou shall have a song\nAs in the night when a holy festival is kept,\nAnd gladness of heart as when one goes with a flute,\nTo come into the mountain of the LORD,\nTo the Mighty One of Israel.\nThe LORD will cause His glorious voice to be heard,\nAnd show the descent of His arm,\nWith the indignation of His anger\nAnd the flame of a devouring fire,\nWith scattering, tempest, and hailstones.\nFor through the voice of the LORD\nAssyria will be beaten down,\nAs He strikes with the rod.\nAnd in every place where the staff of punishment passes,\nWhich the LORD lays on him,\nIt will be with tambourines and harps;\nAnd in battles of brandishing He will fight with it.\nFor Tophet was established of old,\nYes, for the king it is prepared.\nHe has made it deep and large;\nIts pyre is fire with much wood;\nThe breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone,\nKindles it.",

      "chapter_text": "LORD\nNow it came to pass in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them. Then the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh with a great army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. And he stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool, on the highway to the Fuller’s Field. And Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to him.\nThen the Rabshakeh said to them, “Say now to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria: “What confidence is this in which you trust? I say you speak of having plans and power for war; but they are mere words. Now in whom do you trust, that you rebel against me? Look! You are trusting in the staff of this broken reed, Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.\n“But if you say to me, ‘We trust in the LORD our God,’ is it not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and said to Judah and Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar’?” ’ Now therefore, I urge you, give a pledge to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses—if you are able on your part to put riders on them! How then will you repel one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and horsemen? Have I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? The LORD said to me, ‘Go up against this land, and destroy it.’ ”\nThen Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it; and do not speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”\nBut the Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, who will eat and drink their own waste with you?”\nThen the Rabshakeh stood and called out with a loud voice in Hebrew, and said, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria! Thus says the king: ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you; nor let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, “The LORD will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.” ’ Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria: ‘Make peace with me by a present and come out to me; and every one of you eat from his own vine and every one from his own fig tree, and every one of you drink the waters of his own cistern; until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards. Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, “The LORD will deliver us.” Has any one of the gods of the nations delivered its land from the hand of the king of Assyria? Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Indeed, have they delivered Samaria from my hand? Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their countries from my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem from my hand?’ ”\nBut they held their peace and answered him not a word; for the king’s commandment was, “Do not answer him.” Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of the Rabshakeh.",

      "chapter_text": "And so it was, when King Hezekiah heard it, that he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD. Then he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz. And they said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah: ‘This day is a day of trouble and rebuke and blasphemy; for the children have come to birth, but there is no strength to bring them forth. It may be that the LORD your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to reproach the living God, and will rebuke the words which the LORD your God has heard. Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.’ ”\nSo the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah. And Isaiah said to them, “Thus you shall say to your master, ‘Thus says the LORD: “Do not be afraid of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me. Surely I will send a spirit upon him, and he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.” ’ ”\n\nThen the Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he heard that he had departed from Lachish. And the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, “He has come out to make war with you.” So when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.” Look! You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by utterly destroying them; and shall you be delivered? Have the gods of the nations delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed, Gozan and Haran and Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar? Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?’ ”\nAnd Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD. Then Hezekiah prayed to the LORD, saying: “O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, the One who dwells between the cherubim, You are God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth. Incline Your ear, O LORD, and hear; open Your eyes, O LORD, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to reproach the living God. Truly, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their lands, and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were not gods, but the work of men’s hands—wood and stone. Therefore they destroyed them. Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You are the LORD, You alone.”\nLORD\nThen Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says the LORD God of Israel, ‘Because you have prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, this is the word which the LORD has spoken concerning him:\n“The virgin, the daughter of Zion,\nHas despised you, laughed you to scorn;\nThe daughter of Jerusalem\nHas shaken her head behind your back!\n“Whom have you reproached and blasphemed?\nAgainst whom have you raised your voice,\nAnd lifted up your eyes on high?\nAgainst the Holy One of Israel.\nBy your servants you have reproached the Lord,\nAnd said, ‘By the multitude of my chariots\nI have come up to the height of the mountains,\nTo the limits of Lebanon;\nI will cut down its tall cedars\nAnd its choice cypress trees;\nI will enter its farthest height,\nTo its fruitful forest.\nI have dug and drunk water,\nAnd with the soles of my feet I have dried up\nAll the brooks of defense.’\n“Did you not hear long ago\nHow I made it,\nFrom ancient times that I formed it?\nNow I have brought it to pass,\nThat you should be\nFor crushing fortified cities into heaps of ruins.\nTherefore their inhabitants had little power;\nThey were dismayed and confounded;\nThey were as the grass of the field\nAnd the green herb,\nAs the grass on the housetops\nAnd grain blighted before it is grown.\n“But I know your dwelling place,\nYour going out and your coming in,\nAnd your rage against Me.\nBecause your rage against Me and your tumult\nHave come up to My ears,\nTherefore I will put My hook in your nose\nAnd My bridle in your lips,\nAnd I will turn you back\nBy the way which you came.” ’\n“This shall be a sign to you:\nYou shall eat this year such as grows of itself,\nAnd the second year what springs from the same;\nAlso in the third year sow and reap,\nPlant vineyards and eat the fruit of them.\nAnd the remnant who have escaped of the house of Judah\nShall again take root downward,\nAnd bear fruit upward.\nFor out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant,\nAnd those who escape from Mount Zion.\nThe zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.\n“Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria:\n‘He shall not come into this city,\nNor shoot an arrow there,\nNor come before it with shield,\nNor build a siege mound against it.\nBy the way that he came,\nBy the same shall he return;\nAnd he shall not come into this city,’\nSays the LORD.\n‘For I will defend this city, to save it\nFor My own sake and for My servant David’s sake.’ ”\n\nThen the angel of the LORD went out, and killed in the camp of the Assyrians one hundred and eighty-five thousand; and when people arose early in the morning, there were the corpses—all dead. So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and went away, returned home, and remained at Nineveh. Now it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. Then Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place.",

And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, went to him and said to him, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live.’ ”\nThen Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to the LORD, and said, “Remember now, O LORD, I pray, how I have walked before You in truth and with a loyal heart, and have done what is good in Your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.\nAnd the word of the LORD came to Isaiah, saying, “Go and tell Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father: “I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; surely I will add to your days fifteen years. I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.” ’ And this is the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing which He has spoken: “Behold, I will bring the shadow on the sundial, which has gone down with the sun on the sundial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward.” So the sun returned ten degrees on the dial by which it had gone down.\nThis is the writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:\nI said,\n“In the prime of my life\nI shall go to the gates of Sheol;\nI am deprived of the remainder of my years.”\nI said,\n“I shall not see YAH,\nThe LORD in the land of the living;\nI shall observe man no more among the inhabitants of the world.\nMy life span is gone,\nTaken from me like a shepherd’s tent;\nI have cut off my life like a weaver.\nHe cuts me off from the loom;\nFrom day until night You make an end of me.\nI have considered until morning—\nLike a lion,\nSo He breaks all my bones;\nFrom day until night You make an end of me.\nLike a crane or a swallow, so I chattered;\nI mourned like a dove;\nMy eyes fail from looking upward.\nO LORD, I am oppressed;\nUndertake for me!\n“What shall I say?\nHe has both spoken to me,\nAnd He Himself has done it.\nI shall walk carefully all my years\nIn the bitterness of my soul.\nO Lord, by these things men live;\nAnd in all these things is the life of my spirit;\nSo You will restore me and make me live.\nIndeed it was for my own peace\nThat I had great bitterness;\nBut You have lovingly delivered my soul from the pit of corruption,\nFor You have cast all my sins behind Your back.\nFor Sheol cannot thank You,\nDeath cannot praise You;\nThose who go down to the pit cannot hope for Your truth.\nThe living, the living man, he shall praise You,\nAs I do this day;\nThe father shall make known Your truth to the children.\n“The LORD was ready to save me;\nTherefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments\nAll the days of our life, in the house of the LORD.”\nNow Isaiah had said, “Let them take a lump of figs, and apply it as a poultice on the boil, and he shall recover.”\nAnd Hezekiah had said, “What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?”",

I am warm,\nI have seen the fire.”\nAnd the rest of it he makes into a god,\nHis carved image.\nHe falls down before it and worships it,\nPrays to it and says,\n“Deliver me, for you are my god!”\nThey do not know nor understand;\nFor He has shut their eyes, so that they cannot see,\nAnd their hearts, so that they cannot understand.\nAnd no one considers in his heart,\nNor is there knowledge nor understanding to say,\n“I have burned half of it in the fire,\nYes, I have also baked bread on its coals;\nI have roasted meat and eaten it;\nAnd shall I make the rest of it an abomination?\nShall I fall down before a block of wood?”\nHe feeds on ashes;\nA deceived heart has turned him aside;\nAnd he cannot deliver his soul,\nNor say, “Is there not a lie in my right hand?”\n\n“Remember these, O Jacob,\nAnd Israel, for you are My servant;\nI have formed you, you are My servant;\nO Israel, you will not be forgotten by Me!\nI have blotted out, like a thick cloud, your transgressions,\nAnd like a cloud, your sins.\nReturn to Me, for I have redeemed you.”\nSing, O heavens, for the LORD has done it!\nShout, you lower parts of the earth;\nBreak forth into singing, you mountains,\nO forest, and every tree in it!\nFor the LORD has redeemed Jacob,\nAnd glorified Himself in Israel.\n\nThus says the LORD, your Redeemer,\nAnd He who formed you from the womb:\n“I am the LORD, who makes all things,\nWho stretches out the heavens all alone,\nWho spreads abroad the earth by Myself;\nWho frustrates the signs of the babblers,\nAnd drives diviners mad;\nWho turns wise men backward,\nAnd makes their knowledge foolishness;\nWho confirms the word of His servant,\nAnd performs the counsel of His messengers;\nWho says to Jerusalem, ‘You shall be inhabited,’\nTo the cities of Judah, ‘You shall be built,’\nAnd I will raise up her waste places;\nWho says to the deep, ‘Be dry!\nAnd I will dry up your rivers’;\nWho says of Cyrus, ‘He is My shepherd,\nAnd he shall perform all My pleasure,\nSaying to Jerusalem, “You shall be built,”\nAnd to the temple, “Your foundation shall be laid.” ’",

Those from the north and the west,\nAnd these from the land of Sinim.”\nSing, O heavens!\nBe joyful, O earth!\nAnd break out in singing, O mountains!\nFor the LORD has comforted His people,\nAnd will have mercy on His afflicted.\n\nBut Zion said, “The LORD has forsaken me,\nAnd my Lord has forgotten me.”\n“Can a woman forget her nursing child,\nAnd not have compassion on the son of her womb?\nSurely they may forget,\nYet I will not forget you.\nSee, I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands;\nYour walls are continually before Me.\nYour sons shall make haste;\nYour destroyers and those who laid you waste\nShall go away from you.\nLift up your eyes, look around and see;\nAll these gather together and come to you.\nAs I live,” says the LORD,\n“You shall surely clothe yourselves with them all as an ornament,\nAnd bind them on you as a bride does.\n“For your waste and desolate places,\nAnd the land of your destruction,\nWill even now be too small for the inhabitants;\nAnd those who swallowed you up will be far away.\nThe children you will have,\nAfter you have lost the others,\nWill say again in your ears,\n‘The place is too small for me;\nGive me a place where I may dwell.’\nThen you will say in your heart,\n‘Who has begotten these for me,\nSince I have lost my children and am desolate,\nA captive, and wandering to and fro?\nAnd who has brought these up?\nThere I was, left alone;\nBut these, where were they?’ ”\nThus says the Lord GOD:\n“Behold, I will lift My hand in an oath to the nations,\nAnd set up My standard for the peoples;\nThey shall bring your sons in their arms,\nAnd your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders;\nKings shall be your foster fathers,\nAnd their queens your nursing mothers;\nThey shall bow down to you with their faces to the earth,\nAnd lick up the dust of your feet.\nThen you will know that I am the LORD,\nFor they shall not be ashamed who wait for Me.”\nShall the prey be taken from the mighty,\nOr the captives of the righteous be delivered?\nBut thus says the LORD:\n“Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away,\nAnd the prey of the terrible be delivered;\nFor I will contend with him who contends with you,\nAnd I will save your children.\nI will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh,\nAnd they shall be drunk with their own blood as with sweet wine.\nAll flesh shall know\nThat I, the LORD, am your Savior,\nAnd your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”",

It shall be that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come and see My glory. I will set a sign among them; and those among them who escape I will send to the nations: to Tarshish and Pul and Lud, who draw the bow, and Tubal and Javan, to the coastlands afar off who have not heard My fame nor seen My glory. And they shall declare My glory among the Gentiles. Then they shall bring all your brethren for an offering to the LORD out of all nations, on horses and in chariots and in litters, on mules and on camels, to My holy mountain Jerusalem,” says the LORD, “as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD. And I will also take some of them for priests and Levites,” says the LORD.\n“For as the new heavens and the new earth\nWhich I will make shall remain before Me,” says the LORD,\n“So shall your descendants and your name remain.\nAnd it shall come to pass\nThat from one New Moon to another,\nAnd from one Sabbath to another,\nAll flesh shall come to worship before Me,” says the LORD.\n“And they shall go forth and look\nUpon the corpses of the men\nWho have transgressed against Me.\nFor their worm does not die,\nAnd their fire is not quenched.\nThey shall be an abhorrence to all flesh.”",
