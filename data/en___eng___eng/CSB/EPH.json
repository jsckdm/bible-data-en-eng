The Holy Spirit is the down payment  of our inheritance, until the redemption of the possession, to the praise of his glory.\n\nThis is why, since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints, I never stop giving thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers. I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father,  would give you the Spirit  , of wisdom and revelation  in the knowledge of him. I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened so that you may know what is the hope  of his calling,  what is the wealth of his glorious inheritance in the saints, and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power  toward us who believe, according to the mighty working of his strength.\n\nHe exercised this power in Christ by raising him from the dead and seating him at his right hand  in the heavens   #— # far above every ruler and authority, power and dominion, and every title given,  , not only in this age but also in the one to come.  And he subjected everything under his feet   , and appointed him  as head  over everything for the church, which is his body,  the fullness  of the one who fills all things  in every way.",

But God, who is rich in mercy,  because of his great love  that he had for us,  made us alive  with Christ even though we were dead  in trespasses. You are saved by grace! He also raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavens in Christ Jesus,  so that in the coming ages  he might display the immeasurable riches  of his grace through his kindness  to us in Christ Jesus. For you are saved by grace  through faith, and this is not from yourselves; it is God’s gift #— # not from works, so that no one can boast. For we are his workmanship, created  in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared ahead of time  for us to do.\n\nSo, then, remember that at one time you were Gentiles in the flesh #— #called “the uncircumcised” by those called “the circumcised,”  which is done in the flesh by human hands.  At that time you were without Christ, excluded from the citizenship of Israel, and foreigners to the covenants of promise,  without hope  and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus, you who were far away have been brought near by the blood  of Christ. For he is our peace, who made both groups one  and tore down the dividing wall of hostility. In his flesh, he made of no effect the law consisting of commands and expressed in regulations, so that he might create  in himself one  new man from the two, resulting in peace. He did this so that he might reconcile both to God in one body  through the cross by which he put the hostility to death.  He came and proclaimed the good news  of peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near.  For through him we both have access  in one Spirit to the Father.  So, then, you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with the saints, and members of God’s household, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets,  with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone. In him the whole building, being put together,  grows into a holy temple in the Lord.  In him you are also being built together  for God’s dwelling  in the Spirit.",

By reading this you are able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ.  This was not made known to people  in other generations as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets  by the Spirit: The Gentiles are coheirs, members of the same body, and partners in the promise  in Christ Jesus through the gospel. I was made a servant of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace that was given to me by the working of his power. \nThis grace was given to me #— #the least of all the saints #— #to proclaim to the Gentiles the incalculable riches  of Christ, and to shed light for all about the administration of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created  all things. This is so that God’s multi-faceted wisdom  may now be made known through the church to the rulers and authorities in the heavens.  This is according to his eternal purpose  accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord. In him we have boldness and confident access  through faith in him.  So, then, I ask you not to be discouraged  over my afflictions on your behalf, for they are your glory. \n\nFor this reason I kneel  before the Father  from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named. I pray that he may grant you, according to the riches  of his glory,  to be strengthened with power  in your inner being  through his Spirit, and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. I pray that you, being rooted and firmly established in love, may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the length and width, height and depth of God’s love,  and to know Christ’s love that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.\nNow to him who is able  to do above and beyond all that we ask or think  according to the power  that works in us #— # to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever.

      "chapter_text": "Therefore I, the prisoner in the Lord,  urge you to walk worthy of the calling you have received, with all humility  and gentleness, with patience,  bearing  with one another in love,  making every effort to keep the unity  of the Spirit  through the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit   #— #just as you were called to one hope  , at your calling #— # one Lord,  one faith,  one baptism, one God  and Father  of all, who is above all and through all and in all. \nNow grace was given to each one of us  according to the measure of Christ’s gift. For it says:\nWhen he ascended   on high,\nhe took the captives captive;\nhe gave gifts to people.   ,\nBut what does “he ascended” mean except that he  also descended to the lower parts of the earth?  , The one who descended is also the one who ascended far above all the heavens,  to fill all things.  And he himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, to build up the body of Christ,  until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of God’s Son,  growing into maturity with a stature  measured by Christ’s fullness. Then we will no longer be little children, tossed by the waves and blown around by every wind of teaching,  by human cunning with cleverness in the techniques of deceit. But speaking the truth in love, let us grow in every way into him who is the head   #— #Christ. From him the whole body, fitted and knit together  by every supporting ligament, promotes the growth  of the body for building itself up in love by the proper working of each individual part.\n\nTherefore, I say this and testify in the Lord: You should no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thoughts. They are darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them and because  of the hardness of their hearts. They became callous and gave themselves over to promiscuity for the practice of every kind of impurity  with a desire for more and more. \nBut that is not how you came to know Christ, assuming you heard about him and were taught by him, as the truth  is in Jesus, to take off  , your former way of life,  the old self  that is corrupted by deceitful desires, to be renewed  in the spirit  of your minds, and to put on  , the new self, the one created  according to God’s likeness  in righteousness and purity of the truth.\nTherefore, putting away  lying, speak the truth, each one to his neighbor,   , because we are members of one another. Be angry and do not sin.   , Don’t let the sun go down on your anger, and don’t give the devil an opportunity. Let the thief no longer steal. Instead, he is to do honest work with his own hands, so that he has something to share  with anyone in need. No foul language should come from your mouth, but only what is good for building up someone in need,  so that it gives grace to those who hear. And don’t grieve God’s Holy Spirit.  You were sealed by him  for the day of redemption.  Let all bitterness, anger and wrath, shouting and slander be removed from you, along with all malice. And be kind  and compassionate  to one another, forgiving  one another, just as God also forgave you  in Christ.",

But sexual immorality  and any impurity  or greed  should not even be heard of  among you, as is proper for saints. Obscene and foolish talking or crude joking are not suitable, but rather giving thanks. For know and recognize this: Every sexually immoral  or impure  or greedy  person, who is an idolater, does not have an inheritance in the kingdom  of Christ and of God.\n\nLet no one deceive you with empty arguments, for God’s wrath  is coming on the disobedient  because of these things. Therefore, do not become their partners. For you were once darkness, but now you are light  in the Lord. Walk as children of light   #— # for the fruit of the light  consists of all goodness, righteousness, and truth   #— # testing  what is pleasing  to the Lord. Don’t participate in the fruitless  works of darkness, but instead expose them. For it is shameful even to mention what is done by them in secret. Everything exposed by the light is made visible,  for what makes everything visible is light. Therefore it is said:\nGet up, sleeper,  and rise up from the dead, \nand Christ will shine on you. \n\nPay careful attention, then, to how you walk #— #not as unwise people but as wise #— # making the most of the time,  , because the days are evil. So don’t be foolish, but understand  what the Lord’s will  is. And don’t get drunk  with wine,  which leads to reckless living, but be filled by the Spirit:  speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making music with your heart to the Lord, giving thanks always for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, submitting to one another in the fear of Christ. \n\nWives,  submit  , to your husbands  as to the Lord, because the husband is the head of the wife  as Christ is the head  of the church. He is the Savior of the body.  Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives are to submit to their husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives,  just as Christ loved  the church and gave himself  for her to make her holy, cleansing  her with the washing of water by the word. He did this to present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or anything like that, but holy and blameless.  In the same way, husbands are to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. For no one ever hates his own flesh but provides and cares for it, just as Christ does for the church, since we are members of his body.  For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife,   and the two will become one flesh.   , This mystery  is profound, but I am talking about Christ and the church.

Don’t work only while being watched, as people-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing God’s will  from your heart. Serve with a good attitude, as to the Lord and not to people,  knowing that whatever good each one does, slave or free, he will receive this back from the Lord. And masters, treat your slaves the same way, without threatening  them, because you know that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism  with him. \n\nFinally, be strengthened by the Lord and by his vast strength.  Put on  the full armor  of God so that you can stand against the schemes of the devil. For our struggle is not against flesh  and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities,  against the cosmic powers of this darkness, against evil,  spiritual forces in the heavens.  For this reason take up the full armor  of God, so that you may be able to resist  in the evil day, and having prepared everything, to take your stand. Stand,  therefore, with truth  like a belt around your waist, righteousness  like armor on your chest,  and your feet sandaled with readiness for the gospel of peace. In every situation take up the shield  of faith  with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.  Take the helmet  of salvation and the sword  of the Spirit   #— #which is the word of God. Pray  at all times in the Spirit  with every prayer and request, and stay alert  with all perseverance and intercession for all the saints. Pray also for me, that the message may be given to me when I open my mouth to make known with boldness  the mystery of the gospel. For this I am an ambassador  in chains. Pray that I might be bold enough to speak about it as I should.\n\nTychicus,  our dearly loved brother and faithful servant  in the Lord, will tell you all the news about me so that you may be informed. I am sending him to you for this very reason, to let you know how we are and to encourage  your hearts. \nPeace to the brothers and sisters, and love with faith, from God the Father  and the Lord Jesus Christ. Grace be with all who have undying love for our Lord Jesus Christ.  ,",
