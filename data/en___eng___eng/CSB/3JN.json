They have testified to your love before the church.  You will do well to send them on their journey  in a manner worthy of God,  since they set out for the sake of the Name,  accepting nothing from pagans.  , Therefore, we ought to support such people so that we can be coworkers with the truth.\n\nI wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have first place among them,  does not receive our authority.  This is why, if I come, I will remind him of the works he is doing, slandering  us with malicious words. And he is not satisfied with that! He not only refuses to welcome fellow believers, but he even stops those who want to do so and expels them from the church.\nDear friend, do not imitate what is evil,  but what is good. The one who does good is of God;  the one who does evil has not seen God.  Everyone speaks well of Demetrius #— #even the truth itself. And we also speak well of him, and you know  that our testimony is true. \n\nI have many things to write you, but I don’t want to write to you with pen and ink. I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face.\nPeace to you. The friends send you greetings. Greet the friends by name.",
