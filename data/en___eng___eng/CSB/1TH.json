We recall, in the presence of our God and Father,  your work produced by faith,  your labor motivated by love, and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.  For we know, brothers and sisters loved  by God,  that he has chosen you,  because our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, in the Holy Spirit,  and with full assurance. You know how we lived among you  for your benefit, and you yourselves became imitators of us and of the Lord when, in spite of severe persecution, you welcomed the message  with joy from the Holy Spirit. As a result, you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia  and Achaia.  For the word of the Lord rang out from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place that your faith  , in God has gone out. Therefore, we don’t need to say anything, for they themselves report  what kind of reception  we had from you: how you turned  to God from idols  to serve the living  and true  God and to wait  for his Son  from heaven, whom he raised from the dead   #— #Jesus, who rescues us  from the coming wrath.",

On the contrary, after we had previously suffered  and were treated outrageously in Philippi,  as you know, we were emboldened by our God to speak the gospel of God to you in spite of great opposition. For our exhortation didn’t come from error or impurity  or an intent to deceive.  Instead, just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted  with the gospel,  so we speak, not to please people, but rather God,  who examines our hearts.  For we never used flattering speech, as you know, or had greedy  motives   #— #God is our witness   #— # and we didn’t seek glory  from people, either from you or from others. Although we could have been a burden as Christ’s apostles,  instead we were gentle  among you, as a nurse  nurtures her own children. We cared so much for you that we were pleased to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become dear to us. For you remember our labor and hardship, brothers and sisters. Working  night and day so that we would not burden any of you, we preached God’s gospel to you. You are witnesses,  and so is God, of how devoutly, righteously,  and blamelessly  we conducted ourselves with you believers. As you know, like a father with his own children,  we encouraged, comforted, and implored each one of you to walk worthy of God,  who calls you into his own kingdom  and glory. \n\nThis is why we constantly thank God, because when you received the word of God that you heard from us, you welcomed it not as a human message, but as it truly is,  the word of God,  which also works effectively in you who believe. For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators of God’s churches in Christ Jesus that are in Judea,  since you have also suffered  the same things from people of your own country,  just as they did from the Jews who killed the Lord Jesus  and the prophets and persecuted us.  They displease God and are hostile to everyone, by keeping us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. As a result, they are constantly filling up their sins to the limit,  and wrath has overtaken them at last. \n\nBut as for us, brothers and sisters, after we were forced to leave you  for a short time (in person, not in heart  ), we greatly desired and made every effort to return  and see you face to face. So we wanted to come to you #— #even I, Paul, time and again #— #but Satan  hindered us. For who is our hope or joy  or crown  of boasting  in the presence of our Lord  Jesus at his coming?  Is it not you?  Indeed you are our glory  and joy!",

For you know what commands we gave you through the Lord Jesus.\nFor this is God’s will,  your sanctification:  that you keep away  from sexual immorality, that each of you knows how to control his own body  in holiness and honor, not with lustful passions,  like the Gentiles, who don’t know God. This means one must not transgress against and take advantage  of a brother or sister in this manner, because the Lord is an avenger of all these offenses, as we also previously told and warned you. For God has not called us to impurity  but to live in holiness. Consequently, anyone who rejects this does not reject man, but God, who gives you his Holy Spirit. \n\nAbout brotherly love: You don’t need me to write you because you yourselves are taught by God  to love one another.  In fact, you are doing this toward all the brothers and sisters in the entire region of Macedonia.  But we encourage you, brothers and sisters, to do this even more, to seek to lead a quiet life,  to mind your own business,  and to work  with your own hands, as we commanded you, so that you may behave properly  in the presence of outsiders and not be dependent on anyone.  ,\n\nWe do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, concerning those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve like the rest, who have no hope.  For if we believe that Jesus died and rose  again,  in the same way, through Jesus,  God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep. For we say this to you by a word from the Lord:  We who are still alive at the Lord’s coming  will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep.  For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout,  , with the archangel’s  voice, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ  will rise first. Then  we who are still alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds  to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord. Therefore encourage  one another with these words.",

For you yourselves know very well that the day of the Lord  will come just like a thief  in the night. When they say, “Peace and security,” then sudden destruction  will come upon them, like labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in the dark, for this day to surprise you like a thief.  For you are all children of light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or the darkness.  So then, let us not sleep, like the rest, but let us stay awake and be self-controlled. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be self-controlled  and put on the armor  of faith and love, and a helmet  of the hope of salvation. For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord  Jesus Christ,  who died for us,  so that whether we are awake or asleep,  we may live together with him.  Therefore encourage one another and build each other up as you are already doing.\n\nNow we ask you, brothers and sisters, to give recognition  to those who labor among you and lead you  in the Lord and admonish you, and to regard them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace  among yourselves. And we exhort you, brothers and sisters:  warn those who are idle,  comfort the discouraged, help the weak, be patient  with everyone. See to it that no one repays evil for evil  to anyone,  but always pursue what is good for one another and for all.  Rejoice  always, pray constantly, give thanks in everything; for this is God’s will  for you in Christ Jesus. Don’t stifle the Spirit. Don’t despise prophecies, but test all things.  Hold on to what is good. Stay away  from every kind of evil.\nNow may the God of peace  himself sanctify you completely. And may your whole spirit,  soul, and body be kept sound and blameless at the coming  of our Lord  Jesus Christ.  He who calls  you  is faithful; he will do it. Brothers and sisters, pray for us also. Greet all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss. I charge you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the brothers and sisters.  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.",
