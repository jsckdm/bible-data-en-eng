These were Naarah’s sons.\nHelah’s sons: Zereth, Zohar,  and Ethnan. Koz fathered Anub, Zobebah,  and the families of Aharhel son of Harum.\n\nJabez  was more honored than his brothers. His mother named him Jabez and said, “I gave birth to him in pain.”\nJabez called out to the God of Israel, “If only you would bless me, extend my border, let your hand be with me, and keep me from harm, so that I will not experience pain.”  And God granted his request.\nChelub brother of Shuhah fathered Mehir, who was the father of Eshton. Eshton fathered Beth-rapha, Paseah, and Tehinnah the father of Irnahash. These were the men of Recah.\nKenaz’s sons: Othniel and Seraiah.\nOthniel’s sons: Hathath and Meonothai. \nMeonothai fathered Ophrah,\nand Seraiah fathered Joab, the ancestor of those in the Craftsmen’s Valley,  for they were craftsmen.\nThe sons of Caleb son of Jephunneh: Iru, Elah, and Naam.\nElah’s son: Kenaz.\nJehallelel’s sons: Ziph, Ziphah, Tiria, and Asarel.\nEzrah’s sons: Jether, Mered, Epher, and Jalon. Mered’s wife Bithiah gave birth to Miriam, Shammai, and Ishbah the father of Eshtemoa. These were the sons of Pharaoh’s daughter Bithiah; Mered had married her. His Judean wife gave birth to Jered the father of Gedor, Heber the father of Soco, and Jekuthiel the father of Zanoah. The sons of Hodiah’s wife, the sister of Naham: the father of Keilah the Garmite and the father of Eshtemoa the Maacathite.\nShimon’s sons: Amnon, Rinnah, Ben-hanan, and Tilon.\nIshi’s sons: Zoheth and Ben-zoheth.\n\nThe sons of Shelah son of Judah: Er the father of Lecah, Laadah the father of Mareshah, the families of the guild  of linen workers at Beth-ashbea, Jokim, the men of Cozeba; and Joash and Saraph, who married Moabites  and returned to Lehem.  These names are from ancient records. They were the potters and residents of Netaim and Gederah. They lived there in the service of the king.\n\nSimeon’s sons:  Nemuel, Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, and Shaul;\nShaul’s sons: his son Shallum, his son Mibsam, and his son Mishma.\nMishma’s sons: his son Hammuel, his son Zaccur, and his son Shimei.\n\nShimei had sixteen sons and six daughters, but his brothers did not have many children, so their whole family did not become as numerous as the Judeans. They lived in Beer-sheba, Moladah, Hazar-shual, Bilhah, Ezem, Tolad, Bethuel, Hormah, Ziklag, Beth-marcaboth, Hazar-susim, Beth-biri, and Shaaraim. These were their cities until David became king. Their villages were Etam, Ain, Rimmon, Tochen, and Ashan #— #five cities, and all their surrounding villages as far as Baal. These were their settlements, and they kept a genealogical record for themselves.\n\nMeshobab, Jamlech, Joshah son of Amaziah,\nJoel, Jehu son of Joshibiah, son of Seraiah, son of Asiel,\nElioenai, Jaakobah, Jeshohaiah, Asaiah, Adiel, Jesimiel, Benaiah, and Ziza son of Shiphi, son of Allon, son of Jedaiah, son of Shimri, son of Shemaiah —\n\nthese mentioned by name were leaders in their families. Their ancestral houses increased greatly. They went to the entrance of Gedor, to the east side of the valley to seek pasture for their flocks. They found rich, good pasture, and the land was broad, peaceful, and quiet,  for some Hamites had lived there previously.\n\nThese  who were recorded by name came in the days of King Hezekiah of Judah, attacked the Hamites’ tents and the Meunites who were found there, and set them apart for destruction,  as they are today. Then they settled in their place because there was pasture for their flocks. Now five hundred men from these sons of Simeon went with Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the descendants of Ishi, as their leaders to Mount Seir.  They struck down  the remnant of the Amalekites who had escaped, and they still live there today.",

He was the firstborn,  but his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph  son of Israel, because Reuben defiled his father’s bed.  He is not listed in the genealogy according to birthright. Although Judah became strong among his brothers  and a ruler came from him,  the birthright was given to Joseph.\nThe sons of Reuben, Israel’s firstborn: \nHanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.\nJoel’s sons: his son Shemaiah,\nhis son Gog, his son Shimei,\nhis son Micah, his son Reaiah,\nhis son Baal, and his son Beerah.\n\nBeerah was a leader of the Reubenites, and King Tiglath-pileser  of Assyria took him into exile. His relatives by their families as they are recorded in their family records: \nJeiel the chief, Zechariah,\nand Bela son of Azaz,\nson of Shema, son of Joel.\nThey settled in Aroer  as far as Nebo and Baal-meon. They also settled in the east as far as the edge of the desert that extends to the Euphrates River, because their herds had increased in the land of Gilead.  During Saul’s reign they waged war against the Hagrites,  who were defeated by their power. And they lived in their tents throughout the region east of Gilead.\n\nThe sons  of Gad lived next to them in the land of Bashan as far as Salecah: \nJoel the chief, Shapham the second in command, Janai, and Shaphat in Bashan.\nTheir relatives according to their ancestral houses: Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jacan, Zia, and Eber #— #seven.\nThese were the sons of Abihail son of Huri,\nson of Jaroah, son of Gilead,\nson of Michael, son of Jeshishai,\nson of Jahdo, son of Buz.\nAhi son of Abdiel, son of Guni, was head of their ancestral family.  They lived in Gilead, in Bashan and its surrounding villages, and throughout the pasturelands of Sharon.  All of them were registered in the genealogies during the reigns of Judah’s King Jotham  and Israel’s King Jeroboam. \n\nThe descendants of Reuben and Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh had 44,760 warriors who could serve  in the army #— #men who carried shield and sword, drew the bow, and were trained for war. They waged war against the Hagrites,  Jetur,  Naphish, and Nodab. They received help against these enemies because they cried out to God in battle, and the Hagrites and all their allies were handed over to them.  He was receptive to their prayer because they trusted in him.  They captured the Hagrites’ livestock #— #fifty thousand of their camels, two hundred fifty thousand sheep, and two thousand donkeys #— #as well as one hundred thousand people. Many of the Hagrites were killed because it was God’s battle.  And they lived there in the Hagrites’ place  until the exile. \n\nThe descendants of half the tribe of Manasseh settled in the land from Bashan to Baal-hermon (that is, Senir  or Mount Hermon); they were numerous. These were the heads of their ancestral families: Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel. They were valiant warriors, famous men, and heads of their ancestral houses. But they were unfaithful to the God of their ancestors. They prostituted themselves  with the gods of the nations  God had destroyed before them.  So the God of Israel roused the spirit of King Pul  (that is, Tiglath-pileser  ) of Assyria, and he took the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh into exile. He took them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and Gozan’s river, where they are until today.",

The first  to live in their towns on their own property again were Israelites, priests, Levites, and temple servants. \nThese people from the descendants of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh settled in Jerusalem:\nUthai son of Ammihud, son of Omri, son of Imri, son of Bani, a descendant  of Perez son of Judah;\nfrom the Shilonites:\nAsaiah the firstborn and his sons;\nand from the descendants of Zerah:\nJeuel and their relatives #— #690 in all.\n\nThe Benjaminites: Sallu son of Meshullam, son of Hodaviah, son of Hassenuah;\nIbneiah son of Jeroham;\nElah son of Uzzi, son of Michri;\nMeshullam son of Shephatiah, son of Reuel, son of Ibnijah;\nand their relatives according to their family records #— #956  in all. All these men were heads of their ancestral families. \n\nThe priests:  Jedaiah; Jehoiarib; Jachin;\nAzariah son of Hilkiah, son of Meshullam, son of Zadok, son of Meraioth, son of Ahitub, the chief official  of God’s temple;\nAdaiah son of Jeroham, son of Pashhur, son of Malchijah;\nMaasai son of Adiel, son of Jahzerah, son of Meshullam, son of Meshillemith, son of Immer;\nand their relatives, the heads of their ancestral families #— #1,760 in all. They were capable men employed in the ministry of God’s temple.\n\nThe Levites: Shemaiah son of Hasshub, son of Azrikam, son of Hashabiah of the Merarites;\nBakbakkar, Heresh, Galal, and Mattaniah, son of Mica, son of Zichri, son of Asaph;\nObadiah son of Shemaiah, son of Galal, son of Jeduthun;\nand Berechiah son of Asa, son of Elkanah who lived in the settlements of the Netophathites.\n\nThe gatekeepers:  Shallum, Akkub, Talmon, Ahiman, and their relatives.\nShallum was their chief; he was previously stationed at the King’s Gate on the east side.  These were the gatekeepers from the camp of the Levites.\nShallum son of Kore, son of Ebiasaph, son of Korah and his relatives from his ancestral family, the Korahites, were assigned to guard the thresholds of the tent.  Their ancestors had been assigned to the LORD’s camp as guardians of the entrance.  In earlier times Phinehas son of Eleazar had been their leader, and the LORD was with him.  Zechariah son of Meshelemiah was the gatekeeper at the entrance to the tent of meeting. \n\nThe total number of those chosen to be gatekeepers at the thresholds was 212. They were registered by genealogy in their settlements. David and the seer Samuel had appointed them  to their trusted positions. So they and their sons were assigned as guards to the gates of the LORD’s temple, which had been the tent-temple. The gatekeepers were on the four sides: east, west, north, and south. Their relatives came from their settlements  at fixed times to be with them seven days,  but the four chief gatekeepers, who were Levites, were entrusted with the rooms and the treasuries of God’s temple.  They spent the night in the vicinity of God’s temple, because they had guard duty and were in charge of opening it every morning. \nSome of them were in charge of the utensils used in worship. They would count them when they brought them in and when they took them out. Others were put in charge of the furnishings and all the utensils of the sanctuary,  as well as the fine flour,  wine, oil, incense, and spices. Some of the priests’ sons mixed the spices.  A Levite called Mattithiah, the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, was entrusted with baking the bread.  Some of the Kohathites’ relatives were responsible for preparing the rows of the Bread of the Presence  every Sabbath.\nThe singers,  the heads of the Levite families, stayed in the temple chambers and were exempt from other tasks because they were on duty day and night.  These  were the heads of the Levite families, chiefs according to their family records; they lived in Jerusalem.\n\nJeiel fathered Gibeon and lived in Gibeon. His wife’s name was Maacah. Abdon was his firstborn son, then Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab, Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah, and Mikloth. Mikloth fathered Shimeam. These also lived opposite their relatives in Jerusalem with their other relatives.\nNer fathered Kish, Kish fathered Saul, and Saul fathered Jonathan, Malchishua, Abinadab, and Esh-baal.\nJonathan’s son was Merib-baal, and Merib-baal fathered Micah.\nMicah’s sons: Pithon, Melech, Tahrea, and Ahaz. \nAhaz fathered Jarah;\nJarah fathered Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri;\nZimri fathered Moza.\nMoza fathered Binea.\nHis son was Rephaiah, his son Elasah, and his son Azel.\nAzel had six sons, and these were their names: Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan. These were Azel’s sons.",

Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and run me through with it, or these uncircumcised men will come and torture me.” But his armor-bearer would not do it because he was terrified. Then Saul took his sword and fell on it. When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his own sword and died. So Saul and his three sons died #— #his whole house died together.\nWhen all the men of Israel in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled. So the Philistines came and settled in them.\nThe next day when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons dead on Mount Gilboa. They stripped Saul, cut off his head, took his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to spread the good news to their idols and the people. Then they put his armor in the temple of their gods and hung his skull in the temple of Dagon. \nWhen all Jabesh-gilead heard of everything the Philistines had done to Saul, all their brave men set out and retrieved the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons and brought them to Jabesh. They buried their bones under the oak  in Jabesh  and fasted seven days.\nSaul died for his unfaithfulness to the LORD because he did not keep the LORD’s word.  He even consulted a medium for guidance,  but he did not inquire of the LORD. So the LORD put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse.",

      "chapter_text": "All Israel  came together to David at Hebron and said, “Here we are, your own flesh and blood.  Even previously when Saul was king, you were leading Israel out to battle and bringing us back. The LORD your God also said to you, ‘You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will be ruler over my people Israel.’ ”\nSo all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron. David made a covenant with them at Hebron in the LORD’s presence, and they anointed David king over Israel, in keeping with the LORD’s word through Samuel. \n\nDavid  and all Israel marched to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus); the Jebusites who inhabited the land were there.  The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You will never get in here.” Yet David did capture the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David.\nDavid said, “Whoever is the first to kill a Jebusite will become chief commander.” Joab  son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became the chief.\nThen David took up residence in the stronghold; therefore, it was called the city of David. He built up the city all the way around, from the supporting terraces to the surrounding parts, and Joab restored the rest of the city. David steadily grew more powerful,  and the LORD of Armies was with him.\n\nThe following were the chiefs of David’s warriors who, together with all Israel, strongly supported him in his reign to make him king according to the LORD’s word about Israel.  This  is the list of David’s warriors:\nJashobeam son of Hachmoni was chief  of the Thirty;  he wielded his spear against three hundred and killed them at one time.\nAfter him, Eleazar son of Dodo  the Ahohite was one of the three warriors. He was with David at Pas-dammim when the Philistines had gathered there for battle. There was a portion of a field full of barley, where the troops had fled from the Philistines.  But Eleazar and David  took their stand in the middle of the field and defended it. They killed the Philistines, and the LORD gave them a great victory.\nThree of the thirty chief men went down to David, to the rock at the cave of Adullam,  while the Philistine army was encamped in Rephaim Valley.  At that time David was in the stronghold,  and a Philistine garrison  was at Bethlehem. David was extremely thirsty  and said, “If only someone would bring me water to drink from the well at the city gate of Bethlehem! ” So the Three broke through the Philistine camp and drew water from the well at the gate of Bethlehem. They brought it back to David, but he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out to the LORD. David said, “I would never do such a thing in the presence of my God! How can I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives? ” For they brought it at the risk of their lives. So he would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three warriors.\nAbishai,  Joab’s brother, was the leader of the Three.  He raised his spear against three hundred men and killed them, gaining a reputation among the Three. He was more honored than the Three and became their commander even though he did not become one of the Three.\nBenaiah son of Jehoiada  was the son of a brave man  from Kabzeel, a man of many exploits. Benaiah killed two sons of Ariel of Moab,  and he went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion. He also killed an Egyptian who was seven and a half feet tall.  Even though the Egyptian had a spear in his hand like a weaver’s beam,  Benaiah went down to him with a staff, snatched the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and then killed him with his own spear. These were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who had a reputation among the three warriors. He was the most honored of the Thirty, but he did not become one of the Three. David put him in charge of his bodyguard.\nThe best soldiers  were\nJoab’s brother Asahel, \nElhanan son of Dodo of Bethlehem,\nShammoth the Harorite,\nHelez the Pelonite,\nIra son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,\nAbiezer the Anathothite,\nSibbecai the Hushathite,\nIlai the Ahohite,\nMaharai the Netophathite,\nHeled son of Baanah the Netophathite,\nIthai son of Ribai from Gibeah of the Benjaminites,\nBenaiah the Pirathonite,\nHurai from the wadis of Gaash,\nAbiel the Arbathite,\nAzmaveth the Baharumite,\nEliahba the Shaalbonite,\nthe sons of  ,  Hashem the Gizonite,\nJonathan son of Shagee the Hararite,\nAhiam son of Sachar the Hararite,\nEliphal son of Ur,\nHepher the Mecherathite,\nAhijah the Pelonite,\nHezro the Carmelite,\nNaarai son of Ezbai,\nJoel the brother of Nathan,\nMibhar son of Hagri,\nZelek the Ammonite,\nNaharai the Beerothite, the armor-bearer for Joab son of Zeruiah,\nIra the Ithrite,\nGareb the Ithrite,\nUriah the Hethite,\nZabad son of Ahlai,\nAdina son of Shiza the Reubenite, chief of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,\nHanan son of Maacah,\nJoshaphat the Mithnite,\nUzzia the Ashterathite,\nShama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite,\nJediael son of Shimri and his brother Joha the Tizite,\nEliel the Mahavite,\nJeribai and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam,\nIthmah the Moabite,\nEliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.",

      "chapter_text": "The following were the men who came to David at Ziklag while he was still banned from the presence of Saul son of Kish.  They were among the warriors who helped him in battle. They were archers who could use either the right or left hand, both to sling stones and shoot arrows from a bow.  They were Saul’s relatives  from Benjamin:\nTheir chief was Ahiezer son of Shemaah the Gibeathite.\nThen there was his brother Joash;\nJeziel and Pelet sons of Azmaveth;\nBeracah, Jehu the Anathothite;\nIshmaiah the Gibeonite, a warrior among the Thirty and a leader over the Thirty;\nJeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad the Gederathite;\nEluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, Shephatiah the Haruphite;\nElkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korahites;\nand Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.\n\nSome Gadites defected to David at his stronghold in the desert. They were valiant warriors, trained for battle, expert with shield and spear. Their faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as gazelles on the mountains. \nEzer was the chief, Obadiah second, Eliab third,\nMishmannah fourth, Jeremiah fifth,\nAttai sixth, Eliel seventh,\nJohanan eighth, Elzabad ninth,\nJeremiah tenth, and Machbannai eleventh.\nThese Gadites were army commanders; the least of them was a match for a hundred, and the greatest of them for a thousand.  These are the men who crossed the Jordan in the first month  when it was overflowing all its banks,  and put to flight all those in the valleys to the east and to the west.\nOther Benjaminites and men from Judah also went to David at the stronghold.  David went out to meet them and said to them, “If you have come in peace to help me, my heart will be united with you, but if you have come to betray me to my enemies even though my hands have done no wrong, may the God of our ancestors look on it and judge.”\nThen the Spirit enveloped  , Amasai,  chief of the Thirty, and he said:\nWe are yours, David,\nwe are with you, son of Jesse!\nPeace, peace to you,\nand peace to him who helps you, \nfor your God helps you.\nSo David received them and made them leaders of his troops.\nSome Manassites defected to David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul. However, they did not help the Philistines because the Philistine rulers sent David away after a discussion. They said, “It will be our heads if he defects to his master Saul.”  When David went to Ziklag, some men from Manasseh defected to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, chiefs of thousands in Manasseh. They helped David against the raiders,  for they were all valiant warriors and commanders in the army. At that time, men came day after day to help David until there was a great army, like an army of God.  ,\n\nThe numbers of the armed troops who came to David at Hebron to turn Saul’s kingdom over to him,  according to the LORD’s word,  were as follows:\nFrom the Judahites: 6,800 armed troops bearing shields and spears.\nFrom the Simeonites: 7,100 valiant warriors ready for war.\nFrom the Levites: 4,600 in addition to Jehoiada, leader of the house of Aaron, with 3,700 men; and Zadok,  a young valiant warrior, with 22 commanders from his ancestral family. \nFrom the Benjaminites, the relatives of Saul:  3,000 (up to that time the majority of the Benjaminites maintained their allegiance to the house of Saul).\nFrom the Ephraimites: 20,800 valiant warriors who were famous men in their ancestral families. \nFrom half the tribe of Manasseh: 18,000 designated by name to come and make David king.\nFrom the Issacharites, who understood the times  and knew what Israel should do: 200 chiefs with all their relatives under their command.\nFrom Zebulun: 50,000 who could serve in the army, trained for battle with all kinds of weapons of war, with one purpose  to help David. \nFrom Naphtali: 1,000 commanders accompanied by 37,000 men with shield and spear.\nFrom the Danites: 28,600 trained for battle.\nFrom Asher: 40,000 who could serve in the army, trained for battle.\nFrom across the Jordan #— #from the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh: 120,000 men equipped with all the military weapons of war.\n\nAll these warriors, lined up in battle formation, came to Hebron wholeheartedly determined to make David king over all Israel.

Then let’s bring back the ark of our God, for we did not inquire of him  , in Saul’s days.” Since the proposal seemed right to all the people, the whole assembly agreed to do it.\nSo David assembled all Israel,  from the Shihor of Egypt to the entrance of Hamath,  , to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.  David  and all Israel went to Baalah  (that is, Kiriath-jearim that belongs to Judah) to take from there the ark of God, which bears the name of the LORD who is enthroned between the cherubim.  At Abinadab’s house  they set the ark of God on a new cart. Uzzah and Ahio  were guiding the cart.\nDavid and all Israel were dancing with all their might before God with songs and with lyres, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.  When they came to Chidon’s threshing floor,  Uzzah reached out to hold the ark because the oxen had stumbled. Then the LORD’s anger burned against Uzzah, and he struck him dead because he had reached out to the ark.  So he died there in the presence of God. \nDavid was angry because of the LORD’s outburst against Uzzah, so he named that place Outburst Against Uzzah,  as it is still named today. David feared God that day and said, “How can I ever bring the ark of God to me? ” So David did not bring the ark of God home  to the city of David; instead, he diverted it to the house of Obed-edom of Gath.  The ark of God remained with Obed-edom’s family in his house for three months, and the LORD blessed his family and all that he had.",

These  are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.\nWhen the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, they all went in search of David; when David heard of this, he went out to face them. Now the Philistines had come and raided in Rephaim Valley,  so David inquired of God, “Should I attack the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me? ”\nThe LORD replied, “Attack, and I will hand them over to you.”\nSo the Israelites went up to Baal-perazim, and David defeated the Philistines there. Then David said, “Like a bursting flood, God has used me to burst out against my enemies.” Therefore, they named that place The Lord Bursts Out.  The Philistines abandoned their idols there, and David ordered that they be burned in the fire.\nOnce again the Philistines raided in the valley. So David again inquired of God, and God answered him, “Do not pursue them directly. Circle around them and attack them opposite the balsam trees. When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then go out to battle, for God will have gone out ahead of you to strike down the army of the Philistines.” So David did as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer. Then David’s fame spread throughout the lands, and the LORD caused all the nations to be terrified of him.",

He said to them, “You are the heads of the Levite families. You and your relatives must consecrate yourselves  so that you may bring the ark of the LORD God of Israel to the place I have prepared for it.  For the LORD our God burst out in anger against us because you Levites were not with us the first time, for we didn’t inquire of him about the proper procedures.”  So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel. Then the Levites carried the ark of God the way Moses had commanded according to the word of the LORD: on their shoulders with the poles. \nThen David told the leaders of the Levites to appoint their relatives as singers and to have them raise their voices with joy accompanied by musical instruments #— #harps, lyres, and cymbals.  So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; from his relatives, Asaph son of Berechiah; and from their relatives the Merarites, Ethan son of Kushaiah. With them were their relatives second in rank: Zechariah, Jaaziel,  Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, and the gatekeepers Obed-edom and Jeiel. The singers Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals; Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play harps according to Alamoth   and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead the music with lyres according to the Sheminith . Chenaniah, the leader of the Levites in music, was to direct the music because he was skillful. Berechiah and Elkanah were to be gatekeepers for the ark. The priests, Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, were to blow trumpets  before the ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah were also to be gatekeepers for the ark.\nDavid,  the elders of Israel, and the commanders of thousands went with rejoicing to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-edom.  Because God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD, with God’s help, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams. \nNow David was dressed in a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, as well as the singers and Chenaniah, the music leader of the singers. David also wore a linen ephod. So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouts, the sound of the ram’s horn, trumpets, and cymbals, and the playing of harps and lyres. As the ark of the covenant of the LORD was entering the city of David, Saul’s daughter Michal looked down from the window and saw King David leaping  and dancing, and she despised him in her heart.",

When David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD. Then he distributed to each and every Israelite, both men and women, a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake.\nDavid appointed some of the Levites to be ministers before the ark of the LORD, to celebrate the LORD God of Israel, and to give thanks and praise to him. Asaph was the chief and Zechariah was second to him. Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel played the harps and lyres, while Asaph sounded the cymbals and the priests Benaiah and Jahaziel blew the trumpets regularly before the ark of the covenant of God.\n\nOn that day David decreed for the first time that thanks be given to the LORD by Asaph and his relatives:\nGive thanks  to the LORD; call on his name;\nproclaim his deeds among the peoples. \nSing to him; sing praise to him;\ntell about all his wondrous works!\nBoast in his holy name;\nlet the hearts of those who seek the  LORD  rejoice.\nSeek the  LORD and his strength;\nseek his face always. \nRemember the wondrous works he has done, \nhis wonders, and the judgments he has pronounced,  ,\nyou offspring of Israel his servant,\nJacob’s descendants #— #his chosen ones.\n\nHe is the  LORD our God;\nhis judgments govern the whole earth. \nRemember his covenant forever —\nthe promise he ordained for a thousand generations,\nthe covenant he made with Abraham,\nswore  to Isaac, \nand confirmed to Jacob as a decree,\nand to Israel as a permanent covenant: \n“I will give the land of Canaan to you\nas your inherited portion.” \n\nWhen they  were few in number,\nvery few indeed,  and resident aliens in Canaan\nwandering from nation to nation\nand from one kingdom to another,\nhe allowed no one to oppress them;\nhe rebuked kings on their behalf: \n“Do not touch my anointed ones\nor harm my prophets.” \n\nLet the whole earth sing  to the  LORD.\nProclaim his salvation from day to day.\nDeclare his glory among the nations,\nhis wondrous works among all peoples.\n\nFor the  LORD is great and highly praised; \nhe is feared above all gods. \nFor all the gods of the peoples are worthless idols, \nbut the LORD made the heavens. \nSplendor and majesty are before him;\nstrength and joy are in his place.\nAscribe to the  LORD, families of the peoples,\nascribe to the  LORD glory and strength.\nAscribe to the LORD the glory of his name;\nbring an offering and come before him.\nWorship the  LORD in the splendor of his holiness; \nlet the whole earth tremble  before him.\n\nThe world is firmly established;\nit cannot be shaken.\nLet the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice, \nand let them say among the nations, “The  LORD reigns! ”\nLet the sea and all that fills it resound;\nlet the fields and everything in them exult. \nThen the trees of the forest will shout for joy before the  LORD,\nfor he is coming to judge the earth.\n\nGive thanks to the  LORD, for he is good;\nhis faithful love endures forever. \nAnd say,  “Save us, God of our salvation;\ngather us and rescue us from the nations\nso that we may give thanks to your holy name\nand rejoice in your praise.\nBlessed be the LORD God of Israel \nfrom everlasting to everlasting.”\nThen all the people said, “Amen” and “Praise the LORD.”\nSo David left Asaph and his relatives there before the ark of the LORD’s covenant to minister regularly  before the ark according to the daily requirements.  He assigned Obed-edom  and his  sixty-eight relatives. Obed-edom son of Jeduthun and Hosah  were to be gatekeepers. David left the priest Zadok and his fellow priests before the tabernacle of the LORD at the high place in Gibeon  to offer burnt offerings regularly, morning and evening, to the LORD on the altar of burnt offerings and to do everything that was written in the law of the LORD, which he had commanded Israel to keep.  With them were Heman,  Jeduthun, and the rest who were chosen and designated by name  to give thanks to the LORD  #— #for his faithful love endures forever.  Heman and Jeduthun had with them trumpets and cymbals to play and musical instruments of God.  Jeduthun’s sons were at the city gate.\nThen all the people went home, and David returned home to bless his household.",

I am living in a cedar house while the ark of the LORD’s covenant is under tent curtains.” \nSo Nathan told David, “Do all that is on your mind, for God is with you.”\nBut that night  the word of God came to Nathan: “Go to David my servant and say, ‘This is what the LORD says: You are not the one to build me a house to dwell in.  From the time I brought Israel out of Egypt until today I have not dwelt in a house; instead, I have moved from one tent site to another, and from one tabernacle location to another.  , In all my journeys throughout Israel, have I ever spoken a word to even one of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people, asking: Why haven’t you built me a house of cedar? ’ \n“So now this is what you are to say to my servant David: ‘This is what the LORD of Armies says: I took you from the pasture, from tending the flock, to be ruler over my people Israel.  I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have destroyed all your enemies before you. I will make a name for you like that of the greatest on the earth. I will designate a place for my people Israel and plant them,  so that they may live there and not be disturbed again. Evildoers will not continue to oppress them as they have done ever since the day I ordered judges to be over my people Israel. I will also subdue all your enemies.\n“ ‘Furthermore, I declare to you that the LORD himself will build a house for you. When your time comes to be with your ancestors, I will raise up after you your descendant, who is one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom. He is the one who will build a house for me,  and I will establish his throne forever. I will be his father, and he will be my son.  I will not remove my faithful love from him as I removed it from the one who was before you.  I will appoint him over my house and my kingdom forever, and his throne will be established forever.’ ” \nNathan reported all these words and this entire vision to David.\n\nThen  King David went in, sat in the LORD’s presence, and said,\nWho am I, LORD God, and what is my house that you have brought me this far? This was a little thing to you,  God, for you have spoken about your servant’s house in the distant future. You regard me as a man of distinction,  LORD God. What more can David say to you for honoring your servant? You know your servant. LORD, you have done this whole great thing, making known all these great promises for the sake of your servant and according to your will.  LORD, there is no one like you, and there is no God besides you, as all we have heard confirms. And who is like your people Israel? God, you came to one nation on earth to redeem a people for yourself, to make a name for yourself through great and awesome works by driving out nations before your people you redeemed from Egypt.  You made your people Israel your own people forever, and you, LORD, have become their God. \n\nNow, LORD, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and his house be confirmed forever, and do as you have promised. Let your name be confirmed and magnified forever in the saying, “The LORD of Armies, the God of Israel, is God over Israel.” May the house of your servant David be established before you. Since you, my God, have revealed to  , your servant that you will build him a house, your servant has found courage to pray in your presence. LORD, you indeed are God, and you have promised this good thing to your servant. So now, you have been pleased to bless your servant’s house that it may continue before you forever. For you, LORD, have blessed it, and it is blessed forever.",

The LORD made David victorious wherever he went.\nDavid took the gold shields carried by Hadadezer’s officers and brought them to Jerusalem.

Hadoram brought all kinds of gold, silver, and bronze items.

      "chapter_text": "Some time later,  King Nahash of the Ammonites died, and his son became king in his place. Then David said, “I’ll show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.”\nSo David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. However, when David’s emissaries arrived in the land of the Ammonites to console him, the Ammonite leaders said to Hanun, “Just because David has sent men with condolences for you, do you really believe he’s showing respect for your father? Instead, haven’t his emissaries come in order to scout out, overthrow, and spy on the land? ” So Hanun took David’s emissaries, shaved them, cut their clothes in half at the hips, and sent them away. \nIt was reported to David about his men, so he sent messengers to meet them, since the men were deeply humiliated. The king said, “Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back; then return.”\nWhen the Ammonites realized  they had made themselves repulsive to David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent thirty-eight tons  of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Aram-naharaim, Aram-maacah, and Zobah.  They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and the king of Maacah with his army, who came and camped near Medeba.  The Ammonites also came together from their cities for the battle.\nDavid heard about this and sent Joab and all the elite troops. The Ammonites marched out and lined up in battle formation at the entrance of the city while the kings who had come were in the field by themselves. When Joab saw that there was a battle line in front of him and another behind him, he chose some of Israel’s finest young men  , and lined up in formation to engage the Arameans. He placed the rest of the forces under the command of his brother Abishai. They lined up in formation to engage the Ammonites.\n“If the Arameans are too strong for me,” Joab said, “then you’ll be my help. However, if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I’ll help you. Be strong! Let’s prove ourselves strong for our people and for the cities of our God.  May the LORD’s will be done.” \nJoab and the people with him approached the Arameans for battle, and they fled before him. When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had fled, they likewise fled before Joab’s brother Abishai and entered the city. Then Joab went to Jerusalem.\nWhen the Arameans realized that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers to summon the Arameans who were beyond the Euphrates River. They were led by Shophach, the commander of Hadadezer’s army.\nWhen this was reported to David, he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan. He came up to the Arameans and lined up against them. When David lined up to engage them, they fought against him. But the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers.

He came to Rabbah and besieged it, but David remained in Jerusalem.  Joab attacked Rabbah and demolished it. Then David took the crown from the head of their king,  , , and it was placed on David’s head. He found that the crown weighed seventy-five pounds  of gold, and there was a precious stone in it. In addition, David took away a large quantity of plunder from the city. He brought out the people who were in it and put them to work with saws,  iron picks, and axes.  , David did the same to all the Ammonite cities. Then he and all his troops returned to Jerusalem.\n\nAfter this,  a war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, a descendant of the Rephaim,  , and the Philistines were subdued.\nOnce again there was a battle with the Philistines, and Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath of Gath. The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam. \nThere was still another battle at Gath where there was a man of extraordinary stature with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot #— #twenty-four in all. He, too, was descended from the giant.  When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of David’s brother Shimei killed him.\nThese were the descendants of the giant in Gath killed by David and his soldiers.",

      "chapter_text": "Satan  , rose up against Israel and incited David  to count the people of Israel. So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, “Go and count Israel from Beer-sheba to Dan and bring a report to me so I can know their number.” \nJoab replied, “May the LORD multiply the number of his people a hundred times over!  My lord the king, aren’t they all my lord’s servants? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel? ”\nYet the king’s order prevailed over Joab. So Joab left and traveled throughout Israel and then returned to Jerusalem. Joab gave the total troop registration to David. In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand armed men  and in Judah itself four hundred seventy thousand armed men. But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the count because the king’s command was detestable to him. This command was also evil in God’s sight, so he afflicted Israel.\nDavid said to God, “I have sinned greatly because I have done this thing. Now, please take away your servant’s guilt, for I’ve been very foolish.” \n\nThen  the LORD instructed Gad,  David’s seer,  “Go and say to David, ‘This is what the LORD says: I am offering you three choices. Choose one of them for yourself, and I will do it to you.’ ”\nSo Gad went to David and said to him, “This is what the LORD says: ‘Take your choice: three years of famine, or three months of devastation by your foes with the sword of your enemy overtaking you, or three days of the sword of the LORD  #— #a plague on the land, the angel of the LORD bringing destruction to the whole territory of Israel.’ Now decide what answer I should take back to the one who sent me.”\nDavid answered Gad, “I’m in anguish. Please, let me fall into the LORD’s hands because his mercies are very great,  but don’t let me fall into human hands.”\nSo the LORD sent a plague on Israel, and seventy thousand Israelite men died. Then God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but when the angel was about to destroy the city,  the LORD looked, relented concerning the destruction,  and said to the angel who was destroying the people, “Enough, withdraw your hand now! ” The angel of the LORD was then standing at the threshing floor of Ornan  the Jebusite.\nWhen David looked up and saw the angel of the LORD standing between earth and heaven, with his drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem, David and the elders, covered in sackcloth,  fell facedown. David said to God, “Wasn’t I the one who gave the order to count the people? I am the one who has sinned and acted very wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? LORD my God, please let your hand be against me and against my father’s family, but don’t let the plague be against your people.”\n\nSo the angel of the LORD ordered Gad  to tell David to go and set up an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.  David went up at Gad’s command spoken in the name of the LORD.\nOrnan was threshing wheat when he turned and saw the angel. His four sons, who were with him, hid. David came to Ornan, and when Ornan looked and saw David, he left the threshing floor and bowed to David with his face to the ground.\nThen David said to Ornan, “Give me this threshing-floor plot so that I may build an altar to the LORD on it. Give it to me for the full price, so the plague on the people may be stopped.”\nOrnan said to David, “Take it! My lord the king may do whatever he wants.  See, I give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering #— #I give it all.”\nKing David answered Ornan, “No, I insist on paying the full price, for I will not take for the LORD what belongs to you or offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing.”\nSo David gave Ornan fifteen pounds of gold  for the plot. He built an altar to the LORD there and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. He called on the LORD, and he answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering. \nThen the LORD spoke to the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath. At that time, David offered sacrifices there when he saw that the LORD answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. The tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering were at the high place in Gibeon,  but David could not go before it to inquire of God, because he was terrified of the sword of the LORD’s angel.",

You are not to build a house for my name because you have shed so much blood on the ground before me.  But a son will be born to you; he will be a man of rest. I will give him rest from all his surrounding enemies,  for his name will be Solomon,  , and I will give peace and quiet to Israel during his reign.  He is the one who will build a house for my name. He will be my son, and I will be his father. I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’ \n“Now, my son, may the LORD be with you,  and may you succeed in building the house of the LORD your God, as he said about you. Above all, may the LORD give you insight and understanding when he puts you in charge of Israel so that you may keep the law of the LORD your God.  Then you will succeed if you carefully follow the statutes and ordinances the LORD commanded Moses for Israel.  Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid or discouraged. \n“Notice I have taken great pains to provide for the house of the LORD  #— #3,775 tons of gold, 37,750 tons of silver,  , and bronze and iron that can’t be weighed because there is so much of it. I have also provided timber and stone, but you will need to add more to them. You also have many workers: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and people skilled in every kind of work in gold, silver, bronze, and iron #— #beyond number. Now begin the work, and may the LORD be with you.” \nThen David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon: “The LORD your God is with you, isn’t he? And hasn’t he given you rest on every side?  For he has handed the land’s inhabitants over to me, and the land has been subdued before the LORD and his people. Now determine in your mind and heart to seek the LORD your God.  Get started building the LORD God’s sanctuary so that you may bring the ark of the LORD’s covenant and the holy articles of God to the temple that is to be built  for the name of the LORD.”",

The Levites thirty years old or more were counted;  the total number of men was thirty-eight thousand by headcount.  “Of these,” David said, “twenty-four thousand are to be in charge of the work on the LORD’s temple,  six thousand are to be officers and judges,  four thousand are to be gatekeepers, and four thousand are to praise the LORD with the instruments that I have made for worship.” \nThen David divided them into divisions according to Levi’s sons:  Gershom,  Kohath, and Merari.\nThe Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.\nLadan’s sons: Jehiel was the first, then Zetham, and Joel #— #three.\nShimei’s sons: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran #— #three. Those were the heads of the families of Ladan.\nShimei’s sons: Jahath, Zizah,  Jeush, and Beriah. Those were Shimei’s sons #— #four. Jahath was the first and Zizah was the second; however, Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, so they became one family  and received a single assignment.\nKohath’s sons: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel #— #four.\nAmram’s sons:  Aaron and Moses.\nAaron, along with his descendants,  was set apart forever to consecrate the most holy things, to burn incense in the presence of the LORD,  to minister to him, and to pronounce blessings in his name forever. As for Moses the man of God,  his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.\nMoses’s sons: Gershom and Eliezer.\nGershom’s sons: Shebuel was first.\nEliezer’s sons were Rehabiah, first; Eliezer did not have any other sons, but Rehabiah’s sons were very numerous.\nIzhar’s sons: Shelomith was first.\nHebron’s sons: Jeriah was first, Amariah second, Jahaziel third, and Jekameam fourth.\nUzziel’s sons: Micah was first, and Isshiah second.\nMerari’s sons: Mahli and Mushi.\nMahli’s sons: Eleazar and Kish.\nEleazar died having no sons, only daughters. Their cousins, the sons of Kish, married them.\nMushi’s sons: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth #— #three.\n\nThese were the descendants of Levi by their ancestral families   #— #the family heads, according to their registration by name in the headcount #— #twenty years old or more, who worked in the service of the LORD’s temple.  For David said, “The LORD God of Israel has given rest to his people,  and he has come to stay in Jerusalem forever. Also, the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the equipment for its service”   #— # for according to the last words of David, the Levites twenty years old or more were to be counted #— # “but their duty will be to assist the descendants of Aaron with the service of the LORD’s temple, being responsible for the courts and the chambers, the purification of all the holy things, and the work of the service of God’s temple #— # as well as the rows of the Bread of the Presence,  the fine flour for the grain offering,  the wafers of unleavened bread, the baking,  , the mixing,  and all measurements of volume and length.  They are also to stand every morning to give thanks and praise to the LORD, and likewise in the evening. Whenever burnt offerings are offered to the LORD on the Sabbaths, New Moons,  and appointed festivals, they are to offer them regularly in the LORD’s presence according to the number prescribed for them.  They are to carry out their responsibilities for the tent of meeting, for the holy place,  and for their relatives, the descendants of Aaron,  in the service of the LORD’s temple.”",

Since more leaders were found among Eleazar’s descendants than Ithamar’s, they were divided accordingly: sixteen heads of ancestral families  were from Eleazar’s descendants, and eight heads of ancestral families were from Ithamar’s. They  were assigned by lot, for there were officers of the sanctuary and officers of God among both Eleazar’s and Ithamar’s descendants.\nThe secretary, Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded them in the presence of the king and the officers, the priest Zadok, Ahimelech  son of Abiathar, and the heads of families of the priests and the Levites. One ancestral family  was taken for Eleazar, and then one for Ithamar.\nThe first lot fell to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,\nthe third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,\nthe fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,\nthe seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, \nthe ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,\nthe eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,\nthe thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,\nthe fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,\nthe seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,\nthe nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,\nthe twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,\nthe twenty-third to Delaiah, and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.\n\nThese had their assigned duties for service when they entered the LORD’s temple, according to their regulations, which they received from their ancestor Aaron, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.\n\nAs for the rest of Levi’s sons:\nfrom Amram’s sons: Shubael;\nfrom Shubael’s sons: Jehdeiah.\nFrom Rehabiah:\nfrom Rehabiah’s sons: Isshiah was the first.\nFrom the Izharites: Shelomoth;\nfrom Shelomoth’s sons: Jahath.\nHebron’s  , sons:\nJeriah the first, Amariah the second,\nJahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.\nFrom Uzziel’s sons: Micah;\nfrom Micah’s sons: Shamir.\nMicah’s brother: Isshiah;\nfrom Isshiah’s sons: Zechariah.\nMerari’s sons: Mahli and Mushi,\nand from his sons, Jaaziah his son. \nMerari’s sons, by his son Jaaziah: \nShoham, Zaccur, and Ibri.\nFrom Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.\nFrom Kish, from Kish’s sons: Jerahmeel.\nMushi’s sons: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth.\n\nThose were the descendants of the Levites according to their ancestral families.  They also cast lots the same way as their relatives the descendants of Aaron did in the presence of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the families of the priests and Levites #— #the family heads and their younger brothers alike.",

All of these were among the sons of Obed-edom with their sons and relatives; they were capable men with strength for the work #— #sixty-two from Obed-edom.\nMeshelemiah also had sons and relatives who were capable men #— #eighteen.\nHosah,  from the Merarites, also had sons: Shimri the first (although he was not the firstborn, his father had appointed him as the first), Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, and Zechariah the fourth. The sons and relatives of Hosah were thirteen in all.\n\nThese divisions of the gatekeepers, under their leading men, had duties for ministering in the LORD’s temple, just as their relatives did. They cast lots for each temple gate according to their ancestral families, young and old alike. \nThe lot for the east gate fell to Shelemiah.  They also cast lots for his son Zechariah, an insightful counselor, and his lot came out for the north gate. Obed-edom’s was the south gate, and his sons’ lot was for the storehouses; it was the west gate and the gate of Shallecheth on the ascending highway for Shuppim and Hosah.\nThere were guards stationed at every watch. There were six Levites each day  on the east, four each day on the north, four each day on the south, and two pair at the storehouses. As for the court on the west, there were four at the highway and two at the court. Those were the divisions of the gatekeepers from the descendants of the Korahites and Merarites.\n\nFrom the Levites, Ahijah was in charge of the treasuries of God’s temple and the treasuries of what had been dedicated.  From the sons of Ladan, who were the descendants of the Gershonites through Ladan and were the family heads belonging to Ladan the Gershonite: Jehieli. The sons of Jehieli, Zetham and his brother Joel, were in charge of the treasuries of the LORD’s temple.\nFrom the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites: Shebuel, a descendant of Moses’s son Gershom, was the officer in charge of the treasuries. His relatives through Eliezer: his son Rehabiah, his son Jeshaiah, his son Joram, his son Zichri, and his son Shelomith.  This Shelomith and his relatives were in charge of all the treasuries of what had been dedicated by King David,  by the family heads who were the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and by the army commanders. They dedicated part of the plunder from their battles for the repair of the LORD’s temple. All that the seer Samuel, Saul son of Kish, Abner son of Ner, and Joab son of Zeruiah had dedicated, along with everything else that had been dedicated, were in the care of Shelomith and his relatives.\nFrom the Izrahites: Chenaniah and his sons had duties outside the temple  , as officers and judges  over Israel. From the Hebronites: Hashabiah  and his relatives, 1,700 capable men, had assigned duties in Israel west of the Jordan for all the work of the LORD and for the service of the king. From the Hebronites: Jerijah  was the head of the Hebronites, according to the family records of his ancestors. A search was made in the fortieth year of David’s reign and strong, capable men were found among them at Jazer  in Gilead. There were among Jerijah’s relatives 2,700 capable men who were family heads. King David appointed them over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh as overseers in every matter relating to God and the king.",

Then King David rose to his feet and said, “Listen to me, my brothers and my people. It was in my heart to build a house as a resting place for the ark of the LORD’s covenant  and as a footstool  for our God. I had made preparations to build, but God said to me, ‘You are not to build a house for my name because you are a man of war and have shed blood.’ \n“Yet the LORD God of Israel chose me out of all my father’s family  to be king over Israel forever.  For he chose Judah as leader,  and from the house of Judah, my father’s family, and from my father’s sons,  he was pleased to make me king over all Israel. And out of all my sons   #— #for the LORD has given me many sons #— #he has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the LORD’s kingdom over Israel.  He said to me,  ‘Your son Solomon is the one who is to build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father. I will establish his kingdom forever if he perseveres in keeping my commands and my ordinances as he is doing today.’ \n“So now in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God, observe and follow all the commands of the LORD your God so that you may possess this good land and leave it as an inheritance to your descendants forever.\n“As for you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve him wholeheartedly and with a willing mind,  for the LORD searches every heart and understands the intention of every thought.  If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you abandon him, he will reject you forever.  Realize now that the LORD has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary. Be strong, and do it.” \nThen David gave his son Solomon the plans  for the portico  of the temple and its buildings, treasuries, upstairs rooms, inner rooms, and a room for the mercy seat.  The plans contained everything he had in mind  , for the courts of the LORD’s house, all the surrounding chambers, the treasuries  of God’s house, and the treasuries for what is dedicated. Also included were plans for the divisions of the priests and the Levites; all the work of service in the LORD’s house; all the articles of service of the LORD’s house; the weight of gold for all the articles for every kind of service; the weight of all the silver articles for every kind of service; the weight of the gold lampstands  and their gold lamps, including the weight of each lampstand and its lamps; the weight of each silver lampstand and its lamps, according to the service of each lampstand; the weight of gold for each table for the rows of the Bread of the Presence and the silver for the silver tables; the pure gold for the forks, sprinkling basins, and pitchers; the weight of each gold dish; the weight of each silver bowl; the weight of refined gold for the altar of incense;  and the plans for the chariot of  , the gold cherubim that spread out their wings and cover the ark of the LORD’s covenant. \nDavid concluded, “By the LORD’s hand on me, he enabled me to understand everything in writing, all the details of the plan.” \nThen David said to his son Solomon, “Be strong and courageous,  and do the work. Don’t be afraid or discouraged, for the LORD God, my God, is with you. He won’t leave you or abandon you  until all the work for the service of the LORD’s house is finished. Here are the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of God’s house.  Every willing person of any skill  will be at your disposal for the work, and the leaders and all the people are at your every command.”",

The task is great  because the building will not be built for a human but for the LORD God.  So to the best of my ability I’ve made provision for the house of my God:  gold for the gold articles, silver for the silver, bronze for the bronze, iron for the iron, and wood for the wood, as well as onyx, stones for mounting,  antimony,  , stones of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and a great quantity of marble. Moreover, because of my delight in the house of my God, I now give my personal treasures of gold and silver for the house of my God over and above all that I’ve provided for the holy house: 100 tons  , of gold (gold of Ophir  ) and 250 tons  of refined silver for overlaying the walls of the buildings, the gold for the gold work and the silver for the silver, for all the work to be done by the craftsmen. Now who will volunteer to consecrate himself to the LORD today? ”\nThen the leaders of the households, the leaders of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds,  and the officials in charge of the king’s work  gave willingly. For the service of God’s house they gave 185 tons  of gold and 10,000 gold coins,  , 375 tons  of silver, 675 tons  of bronze, and 4,000 tons  of iron. Whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the LORD’s house under the care of Jehiel  the Gershonite. Then the people rejoiced because of their leaders’ willingness to give, for they had given to the LORD wholeheartedly.  King David also rejoiced greatly.\n\nThen David blessed the LORD in the sight of all the assembly. David said,\nMay you be blessed, LORD God of our father Israel, from eternity to eternity. Yours, LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the splendor and the majesty, for everything in the heavens and on earth belongs to you. Yours, LORD, is the kingdom, and you are exalted as head over all.  Riches and honor come from you, and you are the ruler of everything.  Power and might are in your hand, and it is in your hand to make great and to give strength to all.  Now therefore, our God, we give you thanks and praise your glorious name.\n\nBut who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? For everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from your own hand.  For we are aliens and temporary residents in your presence as were all our ancestors.  Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope.  LORD our God, all this wealth that we’ve provided for building you a house for your holy name comes from your hand; everything belongs to you. I know, my God, that you test the heart  and that you are pleased with what is right.  I have willingly given all these things with an upright heart, and now I have seen your people who are present  here giving joyfully and  willingly to you. LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our ancestors, keep this desire forever in the thoughts of the hearts of your people, and confirm their hearts toward you. Give my son Solomon an undivided heart to keep and to carry out all your commands, your decrees, and your statutes,  and to build the building for which I have made provision. \n\nThen David said to the whole assembly, “Blessed be the LORD your God.” So the whole assembly praised the LORD God of their ancestors.  They knelt low and paid homage to the LORD and the king. \nThe following day they offered sacrifices to the LORD and burnt offerings to the LORD: a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, along with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.  They ate and drank with great joy in the LORD’s presence that day.\n\nThen, for a second time,  they made David’s son Solomon king; they anointed him  as the LORD’s ruler,  and Zadok as the priest. Solomon sat on the LORD’s throne as king in place of his father David. He prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.  All the leaders and the mighty men, and all of King David’s sons as well, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon. The LORD highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel  and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been bestowed on any king over Israel before him. \n\nDavid son of Jesse was king over all Israel.  The length of his reign over Israel was forty years; he reigned in Hebron for seven years and in Jerusalem for thirty-three.  He died at a good old age,  full of days,  riches, and honor, and his son Solomon became king in his place.
