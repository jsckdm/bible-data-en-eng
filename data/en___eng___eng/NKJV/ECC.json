And I set my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under heaven; this burdensome task God has given to the sons of man, by which they may be exercised. I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and indeed, all is vanity and grasping for the wind.\nWhat is crooked cannot be made straight,\nAnd what is lacking cannot be numbered.\nI communed with my heart, saying, “Look, I have attained greatness, and have gained more wisdom than all who were before me in Jerusalem. My heart has understood great wisdom and knowledge.” And I set my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is grasping for the wind.\nFor in much wisdom is much grief,\nAnd he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.",

      "chapter_text": "I said in my heart, “Come now, I will test you with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure”; but surely, this also was vanity. I said of laughter—“Madness!”; and of mirth, “What does it accomplish?” I searched in my heart how to gratify my flesh with wine, while guiding my heart with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was good for the sons of men to do under heaven all the days of their lives.\nI made my works great, I built myself houses, and planted myself vineyards. I made myself gardens and orchards, and I planted all kinds of fruit trees in them. I made myself water pools from which to water the growing trees of the grove. I acquired male and female servants, and had servants born in my house. Yes, I had greater possessions of herds and flocks than all who were in Jerusalem before me. I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the special treasures of kings and of the provinces. I acquired male and female singers, the delights of the sons of men, and musical instruments of all kinds.\nSo I became great and excelled more than all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me.\nWhatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them.\nI did not withhold my heart from any pleasure,\nFor my heart rejoiced in all my labor;\nAnd this was my reward from all my labor.\nThen I looked on all the works that my hands had done\nAnd on the labor in which I had toiled;\nAnd indeed all was vanity and grasping for the wind.\nThere was no profit under the sun.\n\nThen I turned myself to consider wisdom and madness and folly;\nFor what can the man do who succeeds the king?—\nOnly what he has already done.\nThen I saw that wisdom excels folly\nAs light excels darkness.\nThe wise man’s eyes are in his head,\nBut the fool walks in darkness.\nYet I myself perceived\nThat the same event happens to them all.\nSo I said in my heart,\n“As it happens to the fool,\nIt also happens to me,\nAnd why was I then more wise?”\nThen I said in my heart,\n“This also is vanity.”\nFor there is no more remembrance of the wise than of the fool forever,\nSince all that now is will be forgotten in the days to come.\nAnd how does a wise man die?\nAs the fool!\nTherefore I hated life because the work that was done under the sun was distressing to me, for all is vanity and grasping for the wind.\nThen I hated all my labor in which I had toiled under the sun, because I must leave it to the man who will come after me. And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will rule over all my labor in which I toiled and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity. Therefore I turned my heart and despaired of all the labor in which I had toiled under the sun. For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, knowledge, and skill; yet he must leave his heritage to a man who has not labored for it. This also is vanity and a great evil. For what has man for all his labor, and for the striving of his heart with which he has toiled under the sun? For all his days are sorrowful, and his work burdensome; even in the night his heart takes no rest. This also is vanity.\nNothing is better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and that his soul should enjoy good in his labor. This also, I saw, was from the hand of God. For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I? For God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy to a man who is good in His sight; but to the sinner He gives the work of gathering and collecting, that he may give to him who is good before God. This also is vanity and grasping for the wind.",

Why should God be angry at your excuse and destroy the work of your hands? For in the multitude of dreams and many words there is also vanity. But fear God.\n\nIf you see the oppression of the poor, and the violent perversion of justice and righteousness in a province, do not marvel at the matter; for high official watches over high official, and higher officials are over them.\nMoreover the profit of the land is for all; even the king is served from the field.\nHe who loves silver will not be satisfied with silver;\nNor he who loves abundance, with increase.\nThis also is vanity.\nWhen goods increase,\nThey increase who eat them;\nSo what profit have the owners\nExcept to see them with their eyes?\nThe sleep of a laboring man is sweet,\nWhether he eats little or much;\nBut the abundance of the rich will not permit him to sleep.\nThere is a severe evil which I have seen under the sun:\nRiches kept for their owner to his hurt.\nBut those riches perish through misfortune;\nWhen he begets a son, there is nothing in his hand.\nAs he came from his mother’s womb, naked shall he return,\nTo go as he came;\nAnd he shall take nothing from his labor\nWhich he may carry away in his hand.\nAnd this also is a severe evil—\nJust exactly as he came, so shall he go.\nAnd what profit has he who has labored for the wind?\nAll his days he also eats in darkness,\nAnd he has much sorrow and sickness and anger.\nHere is what I have seen: It is good and fitting for one to eat and drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labor in which he toils under the sun all the days of his life which God gives him; for it is his heritage. As for every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, and given him power to eat of it, to receive his heritage and rejoice in his labor—this is the gift of God. For he will not dwell unduly on the days of his life, because God keeps him busy with the joy of his heart.",

This is vanity, and it is an evil affliction.\nIf a man begets a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not satisfied with goodness, or indeed he has no burial, I say that a stillborn child is better than he— for it comes in vanity and departs in darkness, and its name is covered with darkness. Though it has not seen the sun or known anything, this has more rest than that man, even if he lives a thousand years twice—but has not seen goodness. Do not all go to one place?\nAll the labor of man is for his mouth,\nAnd yet the soul is not satisfied.\nFor what more has the wise man than the fool?\nWhat does the poor man have,\nWho knows how to walk before the living?\nBetter is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of desire.\nThis also is vanity and grasping for the wind.\nWhatever one is, he has been named already,\nFor it is known that he is man;\nAnd he cannot contend with Him who is mightier than he.\nSince there are many things that increase vanity,\nHow is man the better?\nFor who knows what is good for man in life, all the days of his vain life which he passes like a shadow? Who can tell a man what will happen after him under the sun?",

Do not take your stand for an evil thing, for he does whatever pleases him.”\nWhere the word of a king is, there is power;\nAnd who may say to him, “What are you doing?”\nHe who keeps his command will experience nothing harmful;\nAnd a wise man’s heart discerns both time and judgment,\nBecause for every matter there is a time and judgment,\nThough the misery of man increases greatly.\nFor he does not know what will happen;\nSo who can tell him when it will occur?\nNo one has power over the spirit to retain the spirit,\nAnd no one has power in the day of death.\nThere is no release from that war,\nAnd wickedness will not deliver those who are given to it.\nAll this I have seen, and applied my heart to every work that is done under the sun: There is a time in which one man rules over another to his own hurt.\n\nThen I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of holiness, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done. This also is vanity. Because the sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. Though a sinner does evil a hundred times, and his days are prolonged, yet I surely know that it will be well with those who fear God, who fear before Him. But it will not be well with the wicked; nor will he prolong his days, which are as a shadow, because he does not fear before God.\nThere is a vanity which occurs on earth, that there are just men to whom it happens according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked men to whom it happens according to the work of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.\nSo I commended enjoyment, because a man has nothing better under the sun than to eat, drink, and be merry; for this will remain with him in his labor all the days of his life which God gives him under the sun.\nWhen I applied my heart to know wisdom and to see the business that is done on earth, even though one sees no sleep day or night, then I saw all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun. For though a man labors to discover it, yet he will not find it; moreover, though a wise man attempts to know it, he will not be able to find it.",

People know neither love nor hatred by anything they see before them. All things come alike to all:\nOne event happens to the righteous and the wicked;\nTo the good, the clean, and the unclean;\nTo him who sacrifices and him who does not sacrifice.\nAs is the good, so is the sinner;\nHe who takes an oath as he who fears an oath.\nThis is an evil in all that is done under the sun: that one thing happens to all. Truly the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil; madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead. But for him who is joined to all the living there is hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion.\nFor the living know that they will die;\nBut the dead know nothing,\nAnd they have no more reward,\nFor the memory of them is forgotten.\nAlso their love, their hatred, and their envy have now perished;\nNevermore will they have a share\nIn anything done under the sun.\nGo, eat your bread with joy,\nAnd drink your wine with a merry heart;\nFor God has already accepted your works.\nLet your garments always be white,\nAnd let your head lack no oil.\nLive joyfully with the wife whom you love all the days of your vain life which He has given you under the sun, all your days of vanity; for that is your portion in life, and in the labor which you perform under the sun.\nWhatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work or device or knowledge or wisdom in the grave where you are going.\nI returned and saw under the sun that—\nThe race is not to the swift,\nNor the battle to the strong,\nNor bread to the wise,\nNor riches to men of understanding,\nNor favor to men of skill;\nBut time and chance happen to them all.\nFor man also does not know his time:\nLike fish taken in a cruel net,\nLike birds caught in a snare,\nSo the sons of men are snared in an evil time,\nWhen it falls suddenly upon them.\n\nThis wisdom I have also seen under the sun, and it seemed great to me: There was a little city with few men in it; and a great king came against it, besieged it, and built great snares around it. Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city. Yet no one remembered that same poor man.\nThen I said:\n“Wisdom is better than strength.\nNevertheless the poor man’s wisdom is despised,\nAnd his words are not heard.\nWords of the wise, spoken quietly, should be heard\nRather than the shout of a ruler of fools.\nWisdom is better than weapons of war;\nBut one sinner destroys much good.”",
