And the LORD said to him, “Name him Jezreel; for in just a little while I will punish the house of Jehu for the bloodshed of Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel. On that day I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel.”\nThen she conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. And the LORD said to him, “Name her Lo-ruhamah, for I will no longer take pity on the house of Israel, that I would ever forgive them. But I will take pity on the house of Judah and save them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, sword, battle, horses, or horsemen.”\nWhen she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and gave birth to a son. And the LORD said, “Name him Lo-ammi, because you are not My people, and I am not your God.”\n¶Yet the number of the sons of Israel\nWill be like the sand of the sea,\nWhich cannot be measured or counted;\nAnd in the place\nWhere it is said to them,\n“You are not My people,”\nIt will be said to them,\n“You are the sons of the living God.”\nAnd the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel will be gathered together,\nAnd they will appoint for themselves one leader,\nAnd they will go up from the land,\nFor the day of Jezreel will be great.",
