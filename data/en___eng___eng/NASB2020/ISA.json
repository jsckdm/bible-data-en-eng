It will go badly for him,\nFor what he deserves will be done to him.\nMy people! Their oppressors treat them violently,\nAnd women rule over them.\nMy people! Those who guide you lead you astray\nAnd confuse the direction of your paths.\n\n¶The LORD arises to contend,\nAnd stands to judge the people.\nThe LORD enters into judgment with the elders and leaders of His people,\n“It is you who have devoured the vineyard;\nThe goods stolen from the poor are in your houses.\n“What do you mean by crushing My people\nAnd oppressing the face of the poor?”\nDeclares the Lord GOD of armies.\n\n¶Moreover, the LORD said, “Because the daughters of Zion are haughty\nAnd walk with heads held high and seductive eyes,\nAnd go along with mincing steps\nAnd jingle the anklets on their feet,\nThe Lord will afflict the scalp of the daughters of Zion with scabs,\nAnd the LORD will make their foreheads bare.”\nOn that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, headbands, crescent ornaments, dangling earrings, bracelets, veils, headdresses, ankle chains, sashes, perfume boxes, amulets, finger rings, nose rings, festive robes, outer garments, shawls, purses, papyrus garments, undergarments, headbands, and veils.\nNow it will come about that instead of balsam oil there will be a stench;\nInstead of a belt, a rope;\nInstead of well-set hair, a plucked-out scalp;\nInstead of fine clothes, a robe of sackcloth;\nAnd branding instead of beauty.\nYour men will fall by the sword\nAnd your mighty ones in battle.\nAnd her gates will lament and mourn,\nAnd she will sit deserted on the ground.",

And one called out to another and said,\n“Holy, Holy, Holy, is the LORD of armies.\nThe whole earth is full of His glory.”\nAnd the foundations of the thresholds trembled at the voice of him who called out, while the temple was filling with smoke. Then I said,\n“Woe to me, for I am ruined!\nBecause I am a man of unclean lips,\nAnd I live among a people of unclean lips;\nFor my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of armies.”\nThen one of the seraphim flew to me with a burning coal in his hand, which he had taken from the altar with tongs. He touched my mouth with it and said, “Behold, this has touched your lips; and your guilt is taken away and atonement is made for your sin.”\n\nThen I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us?” Then I said, “Here am I. Send me!” And He said, “Go, and tell this people:\n‘Keep on listening, but do not understand;\nAnd keep on looking, but do not gain knowledge.’\n“Make the hearts of this people insensitive,\nTheir ears dull,\nAnd their eyes blind,\nSo that they will not see with their eyes,\nHear with their ears,\nUnderstand with their hearts,\nAnd return and be healed.”\nThen I said, “Lord, how long?” And He answered,\n“Until cities are devastated and without inhabitant,\nHouses are without people\nAnd the land is utterly desolate,\nThe LORD has completely removed people,\nAnd there are many forsaken places in the midst of the land.\n“Yet there will still be a tenth portion in it,\nAnd it will again be subject to burning,\nLike a terebinth or an oak\nWhose stump remains when it is cut down.\nThe holy seed is its stump.”",

When it was reported to the house of David, saying, “The Arameans have taken a stand by Ephraim,” his heart and the hearts of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake from the wind.\nThen the LORD said to Isaiah, “Go out now to meet Ahaz, you and your son Shear-jashub, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the road to the fuller’s field, and say to him, ‘Take care and be calm, have no fear and do not be fainthearted because of these two stumps of smoldering logs, on account of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and the son of Remaliah. Because Aram, with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has planned evil against you, saying, “Let’s go up against Judah and terrorize it, and take it for ourselves by assault and set up the son of Tabeel as king in the midst of it,” this is what the Lord GOD says: “It shall not stand nor shall it come to pass. For the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin (now within another sixty-five years Ephraim will be broken to pieces, so that it is no longer a people), and the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. If you will not believe, you certainly shall not last.” ’ ”\n\nThen the LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying, “Ask for a sign for yourself from the LORD your God; make it deep as Sheol or high as heaven.” But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, nor will I put the LORD to the test!” Then he said, “Listen now, house of David! Is it too trivial a thing for you to try the patience of men, that you will try the patience of my God as well? Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and she will name Him Immanuel. He will eat curds and honey at the time He knows enough to refuse evil and choose good. For before the boy knows enough to refuse evil and choose good, the land whose two kings you dread will be abandoned.\n\nThe LORD will bring on you, on your people, and on your father’s house such days as have not come since the day that Ephraim separated from Judah—the days of the king of Assyria.”\nOn that day the LORD will whistle for the fly that is in the remotest part of the canals of Egypt and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria. They will all come and settle on the steep ravines, on the ledges of the cliffs, on all the thorn bushes, and on all the watering places.\nOn that day the Lord will shave with a razor, hired from regions beyond the Euphrates River (that is, with the king of Assyria), the head and the hair of the legs; and it will also remove the beard.\nNow on that day a person may keep alive only a heifer and a pair of sheep; and because of the abundance of the milk produced he will eat curds, for everyone who is left within the land will eat curds and honey.\nAnd it will come about on that day, that every place where there used to be a thousand vines, valued at a thousand shekels of silver, will become briars and thorns. People will come there with bows and arrows, because all the land will be briars and thorns. As for all the hills which used to be cultivated with the plow, you will not go there for fear of briars and thorns; but they will become a place for pasturing oxen and for sheep to trample.",

Then the LORD said to me, “Name him Maher-shalal-hash-baz; for before the boy knows how to cry out ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria.”\nAgain the LORD spoke to me further, saying,\n“Inasmuch as these people have rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah\nAnd rejoice in Rezin and the son of Remaliah;\nNow therefore, behold, the Lord is about to bring on them the strong and abundant waters of the Euphrates River,\nThat is, the king of Assyria and all his glory;\nAnd it will rise over all its channels and go over all its banks.\n“Then it will sweep on into Judah, it will overflow and pass through,\nIt will reach as far as the neck;\nAnd the spread of its wings will fill the expanse of your land, Immanuel.\n\n¶“Be broken, you peoples, and be shattered;\nAnd listen, all remote places of the earth.\nGet ready, yet be shattered;\nGet ready, yet be shattered.\n“Devise a plan, but it will fail;\nState a proposal, but it will not stand,\nFor God is with us.”\nFor so the LORD spoke to me with mighty power and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,\n“You are not to say, ‘It is a conspiracy!’\nRegarding everything that this people call a conspiracy,\nAnd you are not to fear what they fear or be in dread of it.\n“It is the LORD of armies whom you are to regard as holy.\nAnd He shall be your fear,\nAnd He shall be your dread.\n“Then He will become a sanctuary;\nBut to both houses of Israel, He will be a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense,\nAnd a snare and a trap for the inhabitants of Jerusalem.\n“Many will stumble over them,\nThen they will fall and be broken;\nThey will be snared and caught.”\nBind up the testimony, seal the Law among my disciples. And I will wait for the LORD who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob; I will wait eagerly for Him. Behold, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are for signs and wonders in Israel from the LORD of armies, who dwells on Mount Zion.\nWhen they say to you, “Consult the mediums and the spiritists who whisper and mutter,” should a people not consult their God? Should they consult the dead in behalf of the living? To the Law and to the testimony! If they do not speak in accordance with this word, it is because they have no dawn. They will pass through the land dejected and hungry, and it will turn out that when they are hungry, they will become enraged and curse their king and their God as they face upward. Then they will look to the earth, and behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish; and they will be driven away into darkness.",

For in a very little while My indignation against you will be ended and My anger will be directed toward their destruction.” The LORD of armies will wield a whip against him like the defeat of Midian at the rock of Oreb; and His staff will be over the sea, and He will lift it up the way He did in Egypt. So it will be on that day, that his burden will be removed from your shoulders, and his yoke from your neck; and the yoke will be broken because of fatness.\n¶He has come against Aiath,\nHe has passed through Migron;\nAt Michmash he deposited his baggage.\nThey have gone through the pass, saying,\n“Geba will be our encampment for the night.”\nRamah is terrified, and Gibeah of Saul has fled.\nCry aloud with your voice, daughter of Gallim!\nPay attention, Laishah and wretched Anathoth!\nMadmenah has fled.\nThe inhabitants of Gebim have sought refuge.\nYet today he will halt at Nob;\nHe shakes his fist at the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.\n¶Behold, the Lord, the GOD of armies, will lop off the branches with terrifying power;\nThose also who are tall in stature will be cut down,\nAnd those who are lofty will be brought low.\nHe will cut down the thickets of the forest with an iron axe,\nAnd Lebanon will fall by the Mighty One.",

The peoples will take them along and bring them to their place, and the house of Israel will make them their own possession in the land of the LORD as male and female servants; and they will take their captors captive and will rule over their oppressors.\nAnd it will be on the day when the LORD gives you rest from your hardship, your turmoil, and from the harsh service in which you have been enslaved, that you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon, and say,\n“How the oppressor has ceased,\nAnd how the onslaught has ceased!\n“The LORD has broken the staff of the wicked,\nThe scepter of rulers,\nWhich used to strike the peoples in fury with unceasing strokes,\nWhich subdued the nations in anger with unrestrained persecution.\n“The whole earth is at rest and is quiet;\nThey break forth into shouts of joy.\n“Even the juniper trees rejoice over you, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying,\n‘Since you have been laid low, no tree cutter comes up against us.’\n“Sheol below is excited about you, to meet you when you come;\nIt stirs the spirits of the dead for you, all the leaders of the earth;\nIt raises all the kings of the nations from their thrones.\n“They will all respond and say to you,\n‘Even you have become weak as we,\nYou have become like us.\n‘Your pride and the music of your harps\nHave been brought down to Sheol;\nMaggots are spread out as your bed beneath you\nAnd worms are your covering.’\n“How you have fallen from heaven,\nYou star of the morning, son of the dawn!\nYou have been cut down to the earth,\nYou who defeated the nations!\n“But you said in your heart,\n‘I will ascend to heaven;\nI will raise my throne above the stars of God,\nAnd I will sit on the mount of assembly\nIn the recesses of the north.\n‘I will ascend above the heights of the clouds;\nI will make myself like the Most High.’\n“Nevertheless you will be brought down to Sheol,\nTo the recesses of the pit.\n“Those who see you will stare at you,\nThey will closely examine you, saying,\n‘Is this the man who made the earth tremble,\nWho shook kingdoms,\nWho made the world like a wilderness\nAnd overthrew its cities,\nWho did not allow his prisoners to go home?’\n“All the kings of the nations lie in glory,\nEach in his own tomb.\n“But you have been hurled out of your tomb\nLike a rejected branch,\nClothed with those killed who have been pierced with a sword,\nWho go down to the stones of the pit\nLike a trampled corpse.\n“You will not be united with them in burial,\nBecause you have ruined your country,\nYou have killed your people.\nMay the descendants of evildoers never be mentioned.\n“Prepare a place of slaughter for his sons\nBecause of the wrongdoing of their fathers.\nThey must not arise and take possession of the earth,\nAnd fill the surface of the world with cities.”\n“I will rise up against them,” declares the LORD of armies, “and eliminate from Babylon name and survivors, offspring and descendants,” declares the LORD. “I will also make it the property of the hedgehog and swamps of water, and I will sweep it away with the broom of destruction,” declares the LORD of armies.\n\nThe LORD of armies has sworn, saying, “Certainly, just as I have intended, so it has happened, and just as I have planned, so it will stand, to break Assyria in My land, and I will trample him on My mountains. Then his yoke will be removed from them, and his burden removed from their shoulders. This is the plan devised against the entire earth; and this is the hand that is stretched out against all the nations. For the LORD of armies has planned, and who can frustrate it? And as for His stretched-out hand, who can turn it back?”\n\nIn the year that King Ahaz died, this pronouncement came:\n“Do not rejoice, Philistia, all of you,\nBecause the rod that struck you is broken;\nFor from the serpent’s root a viper will come out,\nAnd its fruit will be a winged serpent.\n“Those who are most helpless will eat,\nAnd the poor will lie down in security;\nI will kill your root with famine,\nAnd it will kill your survivors.\n“Wail, you gate; cry, you city;\nMelt away, Philistia, all of you!\nFor smoke comes from the north,\nAnd there is no straggler in his ranks.\n“What answer will one give the messengers of the nation?\nThat the LORD has founded Zion,\nAnd the poor of His people will take refuge in it.”",

But now the LORD has spoken, saying, “Within three years, as a hired worker would count them, the glory of Moab will become contemptible along with all his great population, and his remnant will be very small and impotent.”",

The land of Judah will become a cause of shame to Egypt; everyone to whom it is mentioned will be in great fear because of the plan of the LORD of armies which He is making against them.\nOn that day five cities in the land of Egypt will be speaking the language of Canaan and swearing allegiance to the LORD of armies; one will be called the City of Destruction.\nOn that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a memorial stone to the LORD beside its border. And it will become a sign and a witness to the LORD of armies in the land of Egypt; for they will cry out to the LORD because of oppressors, and He will send them a Savior and a Champion, and He will save them. So the LORD will make Himself known to Egypt, and the Egyptians will know the LORD on that day. They will even worship with sacrifice and offering, and will make a vow to the LORD and perform it. And the LORD will strike Egypt, striking but healing; so they will return to the LORD, and He will respond to their pleas and heal them.\nOn that day there will be a road from Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrians will come into Egypt and the Egyptians into Assyria; and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.\nOn that day Israel will be the third party to Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth, whom the LORD of armies has blessed, saying, “Blessed is Egypt My people, and Assyria the work of My hands, and Israel My inheritance.”",

On that day,” declares the LORD of armies, “the peg driven into a firm place will give way; it will even break off and fall, and the load that is hanging on it will be cut off, for the LORD has spoken.”",

And the people will be like the priest, the servant like his master, the female servant like her mistress, the buyer like the seller, the lender like the borrower, the creditor like the debtor. The earth will be completely laid waste and completely plundered, for the LORD has spoken this word. The earth dries up and crumbles away, the mainland dries out and crumbles away, the exalted of the people of the earth dwindle. The earth is also defiled by its inhabitants, for they violated laws, altered statutes, and broke the everlasting covenant. Therefore, a curse devours the earth, and those who live on it suffer for their guilt. Therefore, the inhabitants of the earth decrease in number, and few people are left.\n¶The new wine mourns,\nThe vine decays,\nAll the joyful-hearted sigh.\nThe joy of tambourines ceases,\nThe noise of revelers stops,\nThe joy of the harp ceases.\nThey do not drink wine with song;\nIntoxicating drink is bitter to those who drink it.\nThe city of chaos is broken down;\nEvery house is shut up so that no one may enter.\nThere is an outcry in the streets concerning the wine;\nAll joy turns to gloom.\nThe joy of the earth is banished.\nDesolation is left in the city\nAnd the gate is battered to ruins.\nFor so it will be in the midst of the earth among the peoples,\nAs the shaking of an olive tree,\nAs the gleanings when the grape harvest is over.\nThey raise their voices, they shout for joy;\nThey cry out from the west concerning the majesty of the LORD.\nTherefore glorify the LORD in the east,\nThe name of the LORD, the God of Israel,\nIn the coastlands of the sea.\nFrom the ends of the earth we hear songs: “Glory to the Righteous One,”\nBut I say, “I am finished! I am finished! Woe to me!\nThe treacherous deal treacherously,\nAnd the treacherous deal very treacherously.”\nTerror and pit and snare\nConfront you, you inhabitant of the earth.\nThen it will be that the one who flees the sound of terror will fall into the pit,\nAnd the one who climbs out of the pit will be caught in the snare;\nFor the windows above are opened, and the foundations of the earth shake.\nThe earth is broken apart,\nThe earth is split through,\nThe earth is shaken violently.\nThe earth trembles like a heavy drinker\nAnd sways like a hut,\nFor its wrongdoing is heavy upon it,\nAnd it will fall, never to rise again.\nSo it will happen on that day,\nThat the LORD will punish the rebellious angels of heaven on high,\nAnd the kings of the earth on earth.\nThey will be gathered together\nLike prisoners in the dungeon,\nAnd will be confined in prison;\nAnd after many days they will be punished.\nThen the moon will be ashamed and the sun be put to shame,\nFor the LORD of armies will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem,\nAnd His glory will be before His elders.",

He will certainly be gracious to you at the sound of your cry; when He hears it, He will answer you. Although the Lord has given you bread of deprivation and water of oppression, He, your Teacher, will no longer hide Himself, but your eyes will see your Teacher. Your ears will hear a word behind you, saying, “This is the way, walk in it,” whenever you turn to the right or to the left. And you will desecrate your carved images plated with silver, and your cast metal images plated with gold. You will scatter them as a filthy thing, and say to them, “Be gone!”\nThen He will give you rain for your seed which you will sow in the ground, and bread from the yield of the ground, and it will be rich and plentiful; on that day your livestock will graze in a wide pasture. Also the oxen and the donkeys that work the ground will eat seasoned feed, which has been winnowed with shovel and pitchfork. And on every lofty mountain and every high hill there will be streams running with water on the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall. And the light of the full moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven days, on the day the LORD binds up the fracture of His people and heals the wound He has inflicted.\n¶Behold, the name of the LORD comes from a remote place;\nHis anger is burning and dense with smoke;\nHis lips are filled with indignation,\nAnd His tongue is like a consuming fire;\nHis breath is like an overflowing river,\nWhich reaches to the neck,\nTo shake the nations back and forth in a sieve,\nAnd to put in the jaws of the peoples the bridle which leads astray.\nYou will have songs as in the night when you keep the festival,\nAnd gladness of heart as when one marches to the sound of the flute,\nTo go to the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel.\nAnd the LORD will cause His voice of authority to be heard,\nAnd the descending of His arm to be seen in fierce anger,\nAnd in the flame of a consuming fire\nIn cloudburst, downpour, and hailstones.\nFor at the voice of the LORD Assyria will be terrified,\nWhen He strikes with the rod.\nAnd every blow of the rod of punishment,\nWhich the LORD will lay on him,\nWill be with the music of tambourines and lyres;\nAnd in battles, brandishing weapons, He will fight them.\nFor Topheth has long been ready,\nIndeed, it has been prepared for the king.\nHe has made it deep and large,\nA pyre of fire with plenty of wood;\nThe breath of the LORD, like a torrent of brimstone, sets it afire.",

And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a large army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the road to the fuller’s field. Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the secretary, went out to him.\nAnd Rabshakeh said to them, “Say now to Hezekiah, ‘This is what the great king, the king of Assyria says: “What is this confidence that you have? I say, ‘Your plan and strength for the war are only empty words.’ Now on whom have you relied, that you have revolted against me? Behold, you have relied on the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who rely on him. But if you say to me, ‘We trust in the LORD our God,’ is it not He whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, ‘You shall worship before this altar’? Now then, come make a wager with my master the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to put riders on them! How then can you drive back even one official of the least of my master’s servants and rely on Egypt for chariots and horsemen? And have I now come up without the LORD’S approval against this land to destroy it? The LORD said to me, ‘Go up against this land and destroy it.’ ” ’ ”\nThen Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it; and do not speak to us in Judean so that the people who are on the wall hear you.” But Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me only to your master and to you to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, doomed to eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?”\nThen Rabshakeh stood and called out with a loud voice in Judean and said, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria! This is what the king says: ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to save you; and do not let Hezekiah lead you to rely on the LORD, saying, “The LORD will certainly save us. This city will not be handed over to the king of Assyria!” Do not listen to Hezekiah,’ for this is what the king of Assyria says: ‘Surrender to me and come out to me, and eat, each one, of his vine and each of his fig tree, and each drink of the waters of his own cistern, until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards. Beware that Hezekiah does not mislead you, saying, “The LORD will save us.” Has any one of the gods of the nations saved his land from the hand of the king of Assyria? Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? And when have they saved Samaria from my hand? Who among all the gods of these lands have saved their land from my hand, that the LORD would save Jerusalem from my hand?’ ”\nBut they were silent and did not answer him so much as a word; for the king’s command was, “Do not answer him.” Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the secretary, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and reported to him the words of Rabshakeh.",

Then he sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the household, with Shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz. And they said to him, “This is what Hezekiah says: ‘This day is a day of distress, rebuke, and humiliation; for children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to deliver them. Perhaps the LORD your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to taunt the living God, and will avenge the words which the LORD your God has heard. Therefore, offer a prayer for the remnant that is left.’ ”\nSo the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah. And Isaiah said to them, “This is what you shall say to your master: ‘This is what the LORD says: “Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me. Behold, I am going to put a spirit in him so that he will hear news and return to his own land. And I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.” ’ ”\nThen Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that the king had left Lachish. Now he heard them say regarding Tirhakah king of Cush, “He has come out to fight against you,” and when he heard it he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, “This is what you shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah: ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you by saying, “Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.” Behold, you yourself have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, destroying them completely. So will you be saved? Did the gods of the nations which my fathers destroyed save them: Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar? Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, and of Hena and Ivvah?’ ”\n\nThen Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it, and he went up to the house of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD. Hezekiah prayed to the LORD, saying, “LORD of armies, God of Israel, who is enthroned above the cherubim, You are the God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You made heaven and earth. Incline Your ear, LORD, and hear; open Your eyes, LORD, and see; and listen to all the words of Sennacherib, who sent them to taunt the living God. Truly, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries and their lands, and have thrown their gods into the fire, for they were not gods but only the work of human hands, wood and stone. So they have destroyed them. But now LORD, our God, save us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone, LORD, are God.”\n\nThen Isaiah the son of Amoz sent word to Hezekiah, saying, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel says: ‘Because you have prayed to Me about Sennacherib king of Assyria, this is the word that the LORD has spoken against him:\n“She has shown contempt for you and derided you,\nThe virgin daughter of Zion;\nThe daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head behind you!\n“Whom have you taunted and blasphemed?\nAnd against whom have you raised your voice\nAnd haughtily raised your eyes?\nAgainst the Holy One of Israel!\n“Through your servants you have taunted the Lord,\nAnd you have said, ‘With my many chariots I came up to the heights of the mountains,\nTo the remotest parts of Lebanon;\nAnd I cut down its tall cedars and its choice junipers.\nAnd I will come to its highest peak, its thickest forest.\n‘I dug wells and drank waters,\nAnd with the sole of my feet I dried up\nAll the canals of Egypt.’\n“Have you not heard?\nLong ago I did it,\nFrom ancient times I planned it.\nNow I have brought it about\nThat you would turn fortified cities into ruined heaps.\n“Therefore their inhabitants were powerless,\nThey were shattered and put to shame;\nThey were like the vegetation of the field and the green grass,\nLike grass on the housetops that is scorched before it has grown.\n“But I know your sitting down,\nYour going out, your coming in,\nAnd your raging against Me.\n“Because of your raging against Me\nAnd because your complacency has come up to My ears,\nI will put My hook in your nose\nAnd My bridle in your lips,\nAnd I will turn you back by the way that you came.\n“Then this shall be the sign for you: you will eat this year what grows of itself, in the second year what grows from the same, and in the third year sow, harvest, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit. The survivors that are left of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward. For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go, and out of Mount Zion survivors. The zeal of the LORD of armies will perform this.” ’\n“Therefore, this is what the LORD says about the king of Assyria: ‘He will not come to this city nor shoot an arrow there; and he will not come before it with a shield, nor heap up an assault ramp against it. By the way that he came, by the same he will return, and he will not come to this city,’ declares the LORD. ‘For I will protect this city to save it for My own sake, and for My servant David’s sake.’ ”\n\nThen the angel of the LORD went out and struck 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians; and when the rest got up early in the morning, behold, all of the 185,000 were dead. So Sennacherib the king of Assyria departed and returned home and lived in Nineveh. Then it came about, as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword; and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And his son Esarhaddon became king in his place.",

Have you not heard?\nHas it not been declared to you from the beginning?\nHave you not understood from the foundations of the earth?\nIt is He who sits above the circle of the earth,\nAnd its inhabitants are like grasshoppers,\nWho stretches out the heavens like a curtain\nAnd spreads them out like a tent to live in.\nIt is He who reduces rulers to nothing,\nWho makes the judges of the earth meaningless.\nScarcely have they been planted,\nScarcely have they been sown,\nScarcely has their stock taken root in the earth,\nBut He merely blows on them, and they wither,\nAnd the storm carries them away like stubble.\n“To whom then will you compare Me\nThat I would be his equal?” says the Holy One.\nRaise your eyes on high\nAnd see who has created these stars,\nThe One who brings out their multitude by number,\nHe calls them all by name;\nBecause of the greatness of His might and the strength of His power,\nNot one of them is missing.\n¶Why do you say, Jacob, and you assert, Israel,\n“My way is hidden from the LORD,\nAnd the justice due me escapes the notice of my God”?\nDo you not know? Have you not heard?\nThe Everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth\nDoes not become weary or tired.\nHis understanding is unsearchable.\nHe gives strength to the weary,\nAnd to the one who lacks might He increases power.\nThough youths grow weary and tired,\nAnd vigorous young men stumble badly,\nYet those who wait for the LORD\nWill gain new strength;\nThey will mount up with wings like eagles,\nThey will run and not get tired,\nThey will walk and not become weary.",

I am He.’ ”\n¶The coastlands have seen and are afraid;\nThe ends of the earth tremble;\nThey have approached and have come.\nEach one helps his neighbor\nAnd says to his brother, “Be strong!”\nSo the craftsman encourages the smelter,\nAnd he who smooths metal with the hammer encourages him who beats the anvil,\nSaying of the soldering, “It is good”;\nAnd he fastens it with nails,\nSo that it will not totter.\n“But you, Israel, My servant,\nJacob whom I have chosen,\nDescendant of Abraham My friend,\nYou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth\nAnd called from its remotest parts,\nAnd said to you, ‘You are My servant,\nI have chosen you and have not rejected you.\n‘Do not fear, for I am with you;\nDo not be afraid, for I am your God.\nI will strengthen you, I will also help you,\nI will also uphold you with My righteous right hand.’\n“Behold, all those who are angered at you will be shamed and dishonored;\nThose who contend with you will be as nothing and will perish.\n“You will seek those who quarrel with you, but will not find them,\nThose who war with you will be as nothing and non-existent.\n“For I am the LORD your God who takes hold of your right hand,\nWho says to you, ‘Do not fear, I will help you.’\n“Do not fear, you worm Jacob, you people of Israel;\nI will help you,” declares the LORD, “and your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.\n“Behold, I turned you into a new, sharp threshing sledge with double edges;\nYou will thresh the mountains and pulverize them,\nAnd make the hills like chaff.\n“You will winnow them, and the wind will carry them away,\nAnd the storm will scatter them;\nBut you will rejoice in the LORD,\nYou will boast in the Holy One of Israel.\n¶“The poor and needy are seeking water, but there is none,\nAnd their tongues are parched with thirst.\nI, the LORD, will answer them Myself;\nAs the God of Israel I will not abandon them.\n“I will open rivers on the bare heights,\nAnd springs in the midst of the valleys;\nI will make the wilderness a pool of water,\nAnd the dry land fountains of water.\n“I will put the cedar in the wilderness,\nThe acacia, the myrtle, and the olive tree;\nI will place the juniper in the desert,\nTogether with the elm tree and the cypress,\nSo that they may see and recognize,\nAnd consider and gain insight as well,\nThat the hand of the LORD has done this,\nAnd the Holy One of Israel has created it.\n¶“Present your case,” the LORD says.\n“Bring forward your evidence,”\nThe King of Jacob says.\nLet them bring them forward and declare to us what is going to take place;\nAs for the former events, declare what they were,\nSo that we may consider them and know their outcome.\nOr announce to us what is coming;\nDeclare the things that are going to come afterward,\nSo that we may know that you are gods;\nIndeed, do good or evil, that we may be afraid and fear together.\nBehold, you are less than nothing,\nAnd your work is less than nothing!\nHe who chooses you is an abomination.\n¶“I have put one from the north into motion, and he has come;\nFrom the rising of the sun he will call on My name;\nAnd he will come upon rulers as upon mortar,\nAs the potter treads on clay.”\nWho has declared this from the beginning, that we might know?\nOr from former times, that we may say, “He is right!”?\nThere was no one at all who declared,\nThere was no one at all who proclaimed,\nThere was no one at all who heard your words.\n“Previously I said to Zion, ‘Behold, here they are.’\nAnd to Jerusalem, ‘I will give a messenger of good news.’\n“But when I look, there is no one,\nAnd there is no counselor among them\nWho, if I ask, can give an answer.\n“Behold, all of them are false;\nTheir works are nothing,\nTheir cast metal images are wind and emptiness.",

Let him proclaim and declare it;\nAnd, let him confront Me\nBeginning with My establishing of the ancient nation.\nThen let them declare to them the things that are coming\nAnd the events that are going to take place.\n‘Do not tremble and do not be afraid;\nHave I not long since announced it to you and declared it?\nAnd you are My witnesses.\nIs there any God besides Me,\nOr is there any other Rock?\nI know of none.’ ”\n\nThose who fashion an idol are all futile, and their treasured things are of no benefit; even their own witnesses fail to see or know, so that they will be put to shame. Who has fashioned a god or cast an idol to no benefit? Behold, all his companions will be put to shame, for the craftsmen themselves are mere men. Let them all assemble themselves, let them stand up, let them tremble, let them be put to shame together.\nThe craftsman of iron shapes a cutting tool and does his work over the coals, fashioning it with hammers and working it with his strong arm. He also gets hungry and his strength fails; he drinks no water and becomes weary. The craftsman of wood extends a measuring line; he outlines it with a marker. He works it with carving knives and outlines it with a compass, and makes it like the form of a man, like the beauty of mankind, so that it may sit in a house. He will cut cedars for himself, and he takes a holm-oak or another oak and lets it grow strong for himself among the trees of the forest. He plants a laurel tree, and the rain makes it grow. Then it becomes something for a person to burn, so he takes one of them and gets warm; he also makes a fire and bakes bread. He also makes a god and worships it; he makes it a carved image and bows down before it. Half of it he burns in the fire; over this half he eats meat, he roasts a roast, and is satisfied. He also warms himself and says, “Aha! I am warm, I have seen the fire.” Yet the rest of it he makes into a god, his carved image. He bows down before it and worships; he also prays to it and says, “Save me, for you are my god.”\nThey do not know, nor do they understand, for He has smeared over their eyes so that they cannot see, and their hearts so that they cannot comprehend. No one remembers, nor is there knowledge or understanding to say, “I have burned half of it in the fire and also have baked bread over its coals. I roast meat and eat it. Then I make the rest of it into an abomination, I bow down before a block of wood!” He feeds on ashes; a deceived heart has misled him. And he cannot save himself, nor say, “Is there not a lie in my right hand?”\n\n¶“Remember these things, Jacob,\nAnd Israel, for you are My servant;\nI have formed you, you are My servant,\nIsrael, you will not be forgotten by Me.\n“I have wiped out your wrongdoings like a thick cloud\nAnd your sins like a heavy mist.\nReturn to Me, for I have redeemed you.”\nShout for joy, you heavens, for the LORD has done it!\nShout joyfully, you lower parts of the earth;\nBreak into a shout of jubilation, you mountains,\nForest, and every tree in it;\nFor the LORD has redeemed Jacob,\nAnd in Israel He shows His glory.\nThis is what the LORD says, He who is your Redeemer, and the One who formed you from the womb:\n“I, the LORD, am the Maker of all things,\nStretching out the heavens by Myself\nAnd spreading out the earth alone,\nCausing the omens of diviners to fail,\nMaking fools of fortune-tellers;\nCausing wise men to turn back\nAnd making their knowledge ridiculous,\nConfirming the word of His servant\nAnd carrying out the purpose of His messengers.\nIt is I who says of Jerusalem, ‘She shall be inhabited!’\nAnd of the cities of Judah, ‘They shall be built.’\nAnd I will raise her ruins again.\n“I am the One who says to the depth of the sea, ‘Dry up!’\nAnd I will make your rivers dry up.\n“It is I who says of Cyrus, ‘He is My shepherd,\nAnd he will carry out all My desire.’\nAnd he says of Jerusalem, ‘She will be built,’\nAnd of the temple, ‘Your foundation will be laid.’ ”",

Flee from the Chaldeans!\nDeclare with the sound of joyful shouting, proclaim this,\nSend it out to the end of the earth;\nSay, “The LORD has redeemed His servant Jacob.”\nThey did not thirst when He led them through the deserts.\nHe made the water flow out of the rock for them;\nHe split the rock and the water gushed out.\n“There is no peace for the wicked,” says the LORD.",

And rejoice, you earth!\nBreak forth into joyful shouting, mountains!\nFor the LORD has comforted His people\nAnd will have compassion on His afflicted.\n\n¶But Zion said, “The LORD has abandoned me,\nAnd the Lord has forgotten me.”\n“Can a woman forget her nursing child\nAnd have no compassion on the son of her womb?\nEven these may forget, but I will not forget you.\n“Behold, I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands;\nYour walls are continually before Me.\n“Your builders hurry;\nYour destroyers and devastators\nWill leave you.\n“Raise your eyes and look around;\nAll of them gather together, they come to you.\nAs I live,” declares the LORD,\n“You will certainly put them all on as jewelry and bind them on as a bride.\n“For your ruins and deserted places and your destroyed land—\nNow you will certainly be too cramped for the inhabitants,\nAnd those who swallowed you will be far away.\n“The children you lost will yet say in your ears,\n‘The place is too cramped for me;\nMake room for me that I may live here.’\n“Then you will say in your heart,\n‘Who has fathered these for me,\nSince I have been bereaved of my children\nAnd cannot conceive, and I am an exile, and a wanderer?\nAnd who has raised these?\nBehold, I was left alone;\nWhere are these from?’ ”\nThis is what the Lord GOD says:\n“Behold, I will lift up My hand to the nations\nAnd set up My flag to the peoples;\nAnd they will bring your sons in their arms,\nAnd your daughters will be carried on their shoulders.\n“Kings will be your guardians,\nAnd their princesses your nurses.\nThey will bow down to you with their faces to the ground\nAnd lick the dust from your feet;\nAnd you will know that I am the LORD;\nThose who hopefully wait for Me will not be put to shame.\n¶“Can the prey be taken from a mighty man,\nOr the captives of a tyrant be rescued?”\nIndeed, this is what the LORD says:\n“Even the captives of the mighty man will be taken away,\nAnd the prey of a tyrant will be rescued;\nFor I will contend with the one who contends with you,\nAnd I will save your sons.\n“I will feed your oppressors with their own flesh,\nAnd they will become drunk with their own blood as with sweet wine;\nAnd humanity will know that I, the LORD, am your Savior\nAnd your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”",

For I am the LORD your God, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar (the LORD of armies is His name). And I have put My words in your mouth and have covered you with the shadow of My hand, to establish the heavens, to found the earth, and to say to Zion, ‘You are My people.’ ”\n¶Pull yourself up! Pull yourself up! Arise, Jerusalem!\nYou who have drunk from the LORD’S hand the cup of His anger;\nThe chalice of staggering you have drunk to the dregs.\nThere is no one to guide her among all the sons to whom she has given birth,\nNor is there anyone to take her by the hand among all the sons she has raised.\nThese two things have happened to you;\nWho will mourn for you?\nThe devastation and destruction, famine and sword;\nHow shall I comfort you?\nYour sons have fainted,\nThey lie helpless at the head of every street,\nLike an antelope in a net,\nFull of the wrath of the LORD,\nThe rebuke of your God.\n¶Therefore, listen to this, you afflicted,\nWho are drunk, but not with wine:\nThis is what your Lord, the LORD, your God\nWho contends for His people says:\n“Behold, I have taken from your hand the cup of staggering,\nThe chalice of My anger;\nYou will never drink it again.\n“I will put it into the hand of your tormentors,\nWho have said to you, ‘Lie down so that we may walk over you.’\nYou have also made your back like the ground,\nAnd like the street for those who walk over it.”",

And now, what do I have here,” declares the LORD, “seeing that My people have been taken away without reason?” Again the LORD declares, “Those who rule over them howl, and My name is continually reviled all day long. Therefore, My people shall know My name; therefore on that day I am the one who is speaking, ‘Here I am.’ ”\n¶How delightful on the mountains\nAre the feet of one who brings good news,\nWho announces peace\nAnd brings good news of happiness,\nWho announces salvation,\nAnd says to Zion, “Your God reigns!”\nListen! Your watchmen raise their voices,\nThey shout joyfully together;\nFor they will see with their own eyes\nWhen the LORD restores Zion.\nBe cheerful, shout joyfully together,\nYou ruins of Jerusalem;\nFor the LORD has comforted His people,\nHe has redeemed Jerusalem.\nThe LORD has bared His holy arm\nIn the sight of all the nations,\nSo that all the ends of the earth may see\nThe salvation of our God.\n¶Depart, depart, go out from there,\nDo not touch what is unclean;\nGo out of the midst of her, purify yourselves,\nYou who carry the vessels of the LORD.\nBut you will not go out in a hurry,\nNor will you go as fugitives;\nFor the LORD will go before you,\nAnd the God of Israel will be your rear guard.\n\n¶Behold, My Servant will prosper,\nHe will be high and lifted up and greatly exalted.\nJust as many were appalled at you, My people,\nSo His appearance was marred beyond that of a man,\nAnd His form beyond the sons of mankind.\nSo He will sprinkle many nations,\nKings will shut their mouths on account of Him;\nFor what they had not been told, they will see,\nAnd what they had not heard, they will understand.",

The wolf and the lamb will graze together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox; and dust will be the serpent’s food. They will do no evil or harm on all My holy mountain,” says the LORD.",

Who has seen such things?\nCan a land be born in one day?\nCan a nation be given birth all at once?\nAs soon as Zion was in labor, she also delivered her sons.\n“Shall I bring to the point of birth but not give delivery?” says the LORD.\n“Or shall I who gives delivery shut the womb?” says your God.\n\n“Be joyful with Jerusalem and rejoice for her, all you who love her;\nBe exceedingly glad with her, all you who mourn over her,\nSo that you may nurse and be satisfied with her comforting breasts,\nSo that you may drink fully and be delighted with her bountiful breasts.”\nFor this is what the LORD says: “Behold, I extend peace to her like a river,\nAnd the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream;\nAnd you will be nursed, you will be carried on the hip and rocked back and forth on the knees.\n“As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you;\nAnd you will be comforted in Jerusalem.”\nThen you will see this, and your heart will be glad,\nAnd your bones will flourish like the new grass;\nAnd the hand of the LORD will be made known to His servants,\nBut He will be indignant toward His enemies.\nFor behold, the LORD will come in fire,\nAnd His chariots like the whirlwind,\nTo render His anger with fury,\nAnd His rebuke with flames of fire.\nFor the LORD will execute judgment by fire\nAnd by His sword on humanity,\nAnd those put to death by the LORD will be many.\n“Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go to the gardens,\nFollowing one in the center,\nWho eat pig’s flesh, detestable things, and mice,\nWill come to an end altogether,” declares the LORD.\n“For I know their works and their thoughts; the time is coming to gather all the nations and tongues. And they shall come and see My glory. And I will put a sign among them and send survivors from them to the nations: Tarshish, Put, Lud, Meshech, Tubal, and Javan, to the distant coastlands that have neither heard of My fame nor seen My glory. And they will declare My glory among the nations. Then they shall bring all your countrymen from all the nations as a grain offering to the LORD, on horses, in chariots, in litters, on mules, and on camels, to My holy mountain Jerusalem,” says the LORD, “just as the sons of Israel bring their grain offering in a clean vessel to the house of the LORD. I will also take some of them as priests and Levites,” says the LORD.\n“For just as the new heavens and the new earth,\nWhich I make, will endure before Me,” declares the LORD,\n“So will your descendants and your name endure.\n“And it shall be from new moon to new moon\nAnd from Sabbath to Sabbath,\nAll mankind will come to bow down before Me,” says the LORD.\n“Then they will go out and look\nAt the corpses of the people\nWho have rebelled against Me.\nFor their worm will not die\nAnd their fire will not be extinguished;\nAnd they will be an abhorrence to all mankind.”",
