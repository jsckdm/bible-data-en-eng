He saw these visions during the years when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah.\n\nListen, O heavens! Pay attention, earth!\nThis is what the LORD says:\n“The children I raised and cared for\nhave rebelled against me.\nEven an ox knows its owner,\nand a donkey recognizes its master’s care—\nbut Israel doesn’t know its master.\nMy people don’t recognize my care for them.”\nOh, what a sinful nation they are—\nloaded down with a burden of guilt.\nThey are evil people,\ncorrupt children who have rejected the LORD.\nThey have despised the Holy One of Israel\nand turned their backs on him.\n\nWhy do you continue to invite punishment?\nMust you rebel forever?\nYour head is injured,\nand your heart is sick.\nYou are battered from head to foot—\ncovered with bruises, welts, and infected wounds—\nwithout any soothing ointments or bandages.\nYour country lies in ruins,\nand your towns are burned.\nForeigners plunder your fields before your eyes\nand destroy everything they see.\nBeautiful Jerusalem stands abandoned\nlike a watchman’s shelter in a vineyard,\nlike a lean-to in a cucumber field after the harvest,\nlike a helpless city under siege.\nIf the LORD of Heaven’s Armies\nhad not spared a few of us,\nwe would have been wiped out like Sodom,\ndestroyed like Gomorrah.\n\nListen to the LORD, you leaders of “Sodom.”\nListen to the law of our God, people of “Gomorrah.”\n“What makes you think I want all your sacrifices?”\nsays the LORD.\n“I am sick of your burnt offerings of rams\nand the fat of fattened cattle.\nI get no pleasure from the blood\nof bulls and lambs and goats.\nWhen you come to worship me,\nwho asked you to parade through my courts with all your ceremony?\nStop bringing me your meaningless gifts;\nthe incense of your offerings disgusts me!\nAs for your celebrations of the new moon and the Sabbath\nand your special days for fasting—\nthey are all sinful and false.\nI want no more of your pious meetings.\nI hate your new moon celebrations and your annual festivals.\nThey are a burden to me. I cannot stand them!\nWhen you lift up your hands in prayer, I will not look.\nThough you offer many prayers, I will not listen,\nfor your hands are covered with the blood of innocent victims.\nWash yourselves and be clean!\nGet your sins out of my sight.\nGive up your evil ways.\nLearn to do good.\nSeek justice.\nHelp the oppressed.\nDefend the cause of orphans.\nFight for the rights of widows.\n\n“Come now, let’s settle this,”\nsays the LORD.\n“Though your sins are like scarlet,\nI will make them as white as snow.\nThough they are red like crimson,\nI will make them as white as wool.\nIf you will only obey me,\nyou will have plenty to eat.\nBut if you turn away and refuse to listen,\nyou will be devoured by the sword of your enemies.\nI, the LORD, have spoken!”\n\nSee how Jerusalem, once so faithful,\nhas become a prostitute.\nOnce the home of justice and righteousness,\nshe is now filled with murderers.\nOnce like pure silver,\nyou have become like worthless slag.\nOnce so pure,\nyou are now like watered-down wine.\nYour leaders are rebels,\nthe companions of thieves.\nAll of them love bribes\nand demand payoffs,\nbut they refuse to defend the cause of orphans\nor fight for the rights of widows.\n\nTherefore, the Lord, the LORD of Heaven’s Armies,\nthe Mighty One of Israel, says,\n“I will take revenge on my enemies\nand pay back my foes!\nI will raise my fist against you.\nI will melt you down and skim off your slag.\nI will remove all your impurities.\nThen I will give you good judges again\nand wise counselors like you used to have.\nThen Jerusalem will again be called the Home of Justice\nand the Faithful City.”\n\nZion will be restored by justice;\nthose who repent will be revived by righteousness.\nBut rebels and sinners will be completely destroyed,\nand those who desert the LORD will be consumed.\n\nYou will be ashamed of your idol worship\nin groves of sacred oaks.\nYou will blush because you worshiped\nin gardens dedicated to idols.\nYou will be like a great tree with withered leaves,\nlike a garden without water.\nThe strongest among you will disappear like straw;\ntheir evil deeds will be the spark that sets it on fire.\nThey and their evil works will burn up together,\nand no one will be able to put out the fire.",

However, they were unable to carry out their plan.\nThe news had come to the royal court of Judah: “Syria is allied with Israel against us!” So the hearts of the king and his people trembled with fear, like trees shaking in a storm.\nThen the LORD said to Isaiah, “Take your son Shear-jashub and go out to meet King Ahaz. You will find him at the end of the aqueduct that feeds water into the upper pool, near the road leading to the field where cloth is washed. Tell him to stop worrying. Tell him he doesn’t need to fear the fierce anger of those two burned-out embers, King Rezin of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah. Yes, the kings of Syria and Israel are plotting against him, saying, ‘We will attack Judah and capture it for ourselves. Then we will install the son of Tabeel as Judah’s king.’ But this is what the Sovereign LORD says:\n\n“This invasion will never happen;\nit will never take place;\nfor Syria is no stronger than its capital, Damascus,\nand Damascus is no stronger than its king, Rezin.\nAs for Israel, within sixty-five years\nit will be crushed and completely destroyed.\nIsrael is no stronger than its capital, Samaria,\nand Samaria is no stronger than its king, Pekah son of Remaliah.\nUnless your faith is firm,\nI cannot make you stand firm.”\n\nLater, the LORD sent this message to King Ahaz: “Ask the LORD your God for a sign of confirmation, Ahaz. Make it as difficult as you want—as high as heaven or as deep as the place of the dead.”\nBut the king refused. “No,” he said, “I will not test the LORD like that.”\nThen Isaiah said, “Listen well, you royal family of David! Isn’t it enough to exhaust human patience? Must you exhaust the patience of my God as well? All right then, the Lord himself will give you the sign. Look! The virgin will conceive a child! She will give birth to a son and will call him Immanuel (which means ‘God is with us’). By the time this child is old enough to choose what is right and reject what is wrong, he will be eating yogurt and honey. For before the child is that old, the lands of the two kings you fear so much will both be deserted.\n“Then the LORD will bring things on you, your nation, and your family unlike anything since Israel broke away from Judah. He will bring the king of Assyria upon you!”\nIn that day the LORD will whistle for the army of southern Egypt and for the army of Assyria. They will swarm around you like flies and bees. They will come in vast hordes and settle in the fertile areas and also in the desolate valleys, caves, and thorny places. In that day the Lord will hire a “razor” from beyond the Euphrates River—the king of Assyria—and use it to shave off everything: your land, your crops, and your people.\nIn that day a farmer will be fortunate to have a cow and two sheep or goats left. Nevertheless, there will be enough milk for everyone because so few people will be left in the land. They will eat their fill of yogurt and honey. In that day the lush vineyards, now worth 1,000 pieces of silver, will become patches of briers and thorns. The entire land will become a vast expanse of briers and thorns, a hunting ground overrun by wildlife. No one will go to the fertile hillsides where the gardens once grew, for briers and thorns will cover them. Cattle, sheep, and goats will graze there.",

And the LORD said, “Call him Maher-shalal-hash-baz. For before this child is old enough to say ‘Papa’ or ‘Mama,’ the king of Assyria will carry away both the abundance of Damascus and the riches of Samaria.”\nThen the LORD spoke to me again and said, “My care for the people of Judah is like the gently flowing waters of Shiloah, but they have rejected it. They are rejoicing over what will happen to King Rezin and King Pekah. Therefore, the Lord will overwhelm them with a mighty flood from the Euphrates River—the king of Assyria and all his glory. This flood will overflow all its channels and sweep into Judah until it is chin deep. It will spread its wings, submerging your land from one end to the other, O Immanuel.\n\n“Huddle together, you nations, and be terrified.\nListen, all you distant lands.\nPrepare for battle, but you will be crushed!\nYes, prepare for battle, but you will be crushed!\nCall your councils of war, but they will be worthless.\nDevelop your strategies, but they will not succeed.\nFor God is with us!”\nLORD\nThe LORD has given me a strong warning not to think like everyone else does. He said,\n\n“Don’t call everything a conspiracy, like they do,\nand don’t live in dread of what frightens them.\nMake the LORD of Heaven’s Armies holy in your life.\nHe is the one you should fear.\nHe is the one who should make you tremble.\nHe will keep you safe.\nBut to Israel and Judah\nhe will be a stone that makes people stumble,\na rock that makes them fall.\nAnd for the people of Jerusalem\nhe will be a trap and a snare.\nMany will stumble and fall,\nnever to rise again.\nThey will be snared and captured.”\n\nPreserve the teaching of God;\nentrust his instructions to those who follow me.\nI will wait for the LORD,\nwho has turned away from the descendants of Jacob.\nI will put my hope in him.\n\nI and the children the LORD has given me serve as signs and warnings to Israel from the LORD of Heaven’s Armies who dwells in his Temple on Mount Zion.\nSomeone may say to you, “Let’s ask the mediums and those who consult the spirits of the dead. With their whisperings and mutterings, they will tell us what to do.” But shouldn’t people ask God for guidance? Should the living seek guidance from the dead?\nLook to God’s instructions and teachings! People who contradict his word are completely in the dark. They will go from one place to another, weary and hungry. And because they are hungry, they will rage and curse their king and their God. They will look up to heaven and down at the earth, but wherever they look, there will be trouble and anguish and dark despair. They will be thrown out into the darkness.",

He boasts,\n\n“By my own powerful arm I have done this.\nWith my own shrewd wisdom I planned it.\nI have broken down the defenses of nations\nand carried off their treasures.\nI have knocked down their kings like a bull.\nI have robbed their nests of riches\nand gathered up kingdoms as a farmer gathers eggs.\nNo one can even flap a wing against me\nor utter a peep of protest.”\n\nBut can the ax boast greater power than the person who uses it?\nIs the saw greater than the person who saws?\nCan a rod strike unless a hand moves it?\nCan a wooden cane walk by itself?\nTherefore, the Lord, the LORD of Heaven’s Armies,\nwill send a plague among Assyria’s proud troops,\nand a flaming fire will consume its glory.\nThe LORD, the Light of Israel, will be a fire;\nthe Holy One will be a flame.\nHe will devour the thorns and briers with fire,\nburning up the enemy in a single night.\nThe LORD will consume Assyria’s glory\nlike a fire consumes a forest in a fruitful land;\nit will waste away like sick people in a plague.\nOf all that glorious forest, only a few trees will survive—\nso few that a child could count them!\nLORD\nIn that day the remnant left in Israel,\nthe survivors in the house of Jacob,\nwill no longer depend on allies\nwho seek to destroy them.\nBut they will faithfully trust the LORD,\nthe Holy One of Israel.\nA remnant will return;\nyes, the remnant of Jacob will return to the Mighty God.\nBut though the people of Israel are as numerous\nas the sand of the seashore,\nonly a remnant of them will return.\nThe LORD has rightly decided to destroy his people.\nYes, the Lord, the LORD of Heaven’s Armies,\nhas already decided to destroy the entire land.\n\nSo this is what the Lord, the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, says: “O my people in Zion, do not be afraid of the Assyrians when they oppress you with rod and club as the Egyptians did long ago. In a little while my anger against you will end, and then my anger will rise up to destroy them.” The LORD of Heaven’s Armies will lash them with his whip, as he did when Gideon triumphed over the Midianites at the rock of Oreb, or when the LORD’s staff was raised to drown the Egyptian army in the sea.\n\nIn that day the LORD will end the bondage of his people.\nHe will break the yoke of slavery\nand lift it from their shoulders.\n\nLook, the Assyrians are now at Aiath.\nThey are passing through Migron\nand are storing their equipment at Micmash.\nThey are crossing the pass\nand are camping at Geba.\nFear strikes the town of Ramah.\nAll the people of Gibeah, the hometown of Saul,\nare running for their lives.\nScream in terror,\nyou people of Gallim!\nShout out a warning to Laishah.\nOh, poor Anathoth!\nThere go the people of Madmenah, all fleeing.\nThe citizens of Gebim are trying to hide.\nThe enemy stops at Nob for the rest of that day.\nHe shakes his fist at beautiful Mount Zion, the mountain of Jerusalem.\n\nBut look! The Lord, the LORD of Heaven’s Armies,\nwill chop down the mighty tree of Assyria with great power!\nHe will cut down the proud.\nThat lofty tree will be brought down.\nHe will cut down the forest trees with an ax.\nLebanon will fall to the Mighty One.",

He will bring them back to settle once again in their own land. And people from many different nations will come and join them there and unite with the people of Israel. The nations of the world will help the people of Israel to return, and those who come to live in the LORD’s land will serve them. Those who captured Israel will themselves be captured, and Israel will rule over its enemies.\nIn that wonderful day when the LORD gives his people rest from sorrow and fear, from slavery and chains, you will taunt the king of Babylon. You will say,\n\n“The mighty man has been destroyed.\nYes, your insolence is ended.\nFor the LORD has crushed your wicked power\nand broken your evil rule.\nYou struck the people with endless blows of rage\nand held the nations in your angry grip\nwith unrelenting tyranny.\nBut finally the earth is at rest and quiet.\nNow it can sing again!\nEven the trees of the forest—\nthe cypress trees and the cedars of Lebanon—\nsing out this joyous song:\n‘Since you have been cut down,\nno one will come now to cut us down!’\n\n“In the place of the dead there is excitement\nover your arrival.\nThe spirits of world leaders and mighty kings long dead\nstand up to see you.\nWith one voice they all cry out,\n‘Now you are as weak as we are!\nYour might and power were buried with you.\nThe sound of the harp in your palace has ceased.\nNow maggots are your sheet,\nand worms your blanket.’\n\n“How you are fallen from heaven,\nO shining star, son of the morning!\nYou have been thrown down to the earth,\nyou who destroyed the nations of the world.\nFor you said to yourself,\n‘I will ascend to heaven and set my throne above God’s stars.\nI will preside on the mountain of the gods\nfar away in the north.\nI will climb to the highest heavens\nand be like the Most High.’\nInstead, you will be brought down to the place of the dead,\ndown to its lowest depths.\nEveryone there will stare at you and ask,\n‘Can this be the one who shook the earth\nand made the kingdoms of the world tremble?\nIs this the one who destroyed the world\nand made it into a wasteland?\nIs this the king who demolished the world’s greatest cities\nand had no mercy on his prisoners?’\n\n“The kings of the nations lie in stately glory,\neach in his own tomb,\nbut you will be thrown out of your grave\nlike a worthless branch.\nLike a corpse trampled underfoot,\nyou will be dumped into a mass grave\nwith those killed in battle.\nYou will descend to the pit.\nYou will not be given a proper burial,\nfor you have destroyed your nation\nand slaughtered your people.\nThe descendants of such an evil person\nwill never again receive honor.\nKill this man’s children!\nLet them die because of their father’s sins!\nThey must not rise and conquer the earth,\nfilling the world with their cities.”\n\nThis is what the LORD of Heaven’s Armies says:\n“I, myself, have risen against Babylon!\nI will destroy its children and its children’s children,”\nsays the LORD.\n“I will make Babylon a desolate place of owls,\nfilled with swamps and marshes.\nI will sweep the land with the broom of destruction.\nI, the LORD of Heaven’s Armies, have spoken!”\n\nThe LORD of Heaven’s Armies has sworn this oath:\n\n“It will all happen as I have planned.\nIt will be as I have decided.\nI will break the Assyrians when they are in Israel;\nI will trample them on my mountains.\nMy people will no longer be their slaves\nnor bow down under their heavy loads.\nI have a plan for the whole earth,\na hand of judgment upon all the nations.\nThe LORD of Heaven’s Armies has spoken—\nwho can change his plans?\nWhen his hand is raised,\nwho can stop him?”\n\nThis message came to me the year King Ahaz died:\n\nDo not rejoice, you Philistines,\nthat the rod that struck you is broken—\nthat the king who attacked you is dead.\nFor from that snake a more poisonous snake will be born,\na fiery serpent to destroy you!\nI will feed the poor in my pasture;\nthe needy will lie down in peace.\nBut as for you, I will wipe you out with famine\nand destroy the few who remain.\nWail at the gates! Weep in the cities!\nMelt with fear, you Philistines!\nA powerful army comes like smoke from the north.\nEach soldier rushes forward eager to fight.\n\nWhat should we tell the Philistine messengers? Tell them,\n\n“The LORD has built Jerusalem;\nits walls will give refuge to his oppressed people.”",

The LORD is advancing against Egypt,\nriding on a swift cloud.\nThe idols of Egypt tremble.\nThe hearts of the Egyptians melt with fear.\n\n“I will make Egyptian fight against Egyptian—\nbrother against brother,\nneighbor against neighbor,\ncity against city,\nprovince against province.\nThe Egyptians will lose heart,\nand I will confuse their plans.\nThey will plead with their idols for wisdom\nand call on spirits, mediums, and those who consult the spirits of the dead.\nI will hand Egypt over\nto a hard, cruel master.\nA fierce king will rule them,”\nsays the Lord, the LORD of Heaven’s Armies.\n\nThe waters of the Nile will fail to rise and flood the fields.\nThe riverbed will be parched and dry.\nThe canals of the Nile will dry up,\nand the streams of Egypt will stink\nwith rotting reeds and rushes.\nAll the greenery along the riverbank\nand all the crops along the river\nwill dry up and blow away.\nThe fishermen will lament for lack of work.\nThose who cast hooks into the Nile will groan,\nand those who use nets will lose heart.\nThere will be no flax for the harvesters,\nno thread for the weavers.\nThey will be in despair,\nand all the workers will be sick at heart.\n\nWhat fools are the officials of Zoan!\nTheir best counsel to the king of Egypt is stupid and wrong.\nWill they still boast to Pharaoh of their wisdom?\nWill they dare brag about all their wise ancestors?\nWhere are your wise counselors, Pharaoh?\nLet them tell you what God plans,\nwhat the LORD of Heaven’s Armies is going to do to Egypt.\nThe officials of Zoan are fools,\nand the officials of Memphis are deluded.\nThe leaders of the people\nhave led Egypt astray.\nThe LORD has sent a spirit of foolishness on them,\nso all their suggestions are wrong.\nThey cause Egypt to stagger\nlike a drunk in his vomit.\nThere is nothing Egypt can do.\nAll are helpless—\nthe head and the tail,\nthe noble palm branch and the lowly reed.\n\nIn that day the Egyptians will be as weak as women. They will cower in fear beneath the upraised fist of the LORD of Heaven’s Armies. Just to speak the name of Israel will terrorize them, for the LORD of Heaven’s Armies has laid out his plans against them.\nIn that day five of Egypt’s cities will follow the LORD of Heaven’s Armies. They will even begin to speak Hebrew, the language of Canaan. One of these cities will be Heliopolis, the City of the Sun.\nIn that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the heart of Egypt, and there will be a monument to the LORD at its border. It will be a sign and a witness that the LORD of Heaven’s Armies is worshiped in the land of Egypt. When the people cry to the LORD for help against those who oppress them, he will send them a savior who will rescue them. The LORD will make himself known to the Egyptians. Yes, they will know the LORD and will give their sacrifices and offerings to him. They will make a vow to the LORD and will keep it. The LORD will strike Egypt, and then he will bring healing. For the Egyptians will turn to the LORD, and he will listen to their pleas and heal them.\nIn that day Egypt and Assyria will be connected by a highway. The Egyptians and Assyrians will move freely between their lands, and they will both worship God. In that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth. For the LORD of Heaven’s Armies will say, “Blessed be Egypt, my people. Blessed be Assyria, the land I have made. Blessed be Israel, my special possession!”",

And then I will call my servant Eliakim son of Hilkiah to replace you. I will dress him in your royal robes and will give him your title and your authority. And he will be a father to the people of Jerusalem and Judah. I will give him the key to the house of David—the highest position in the royal court. When he opens doors, no one will be able to close them; when he closes doors, no one will be able to open them. He will bring honor to his family name, for I will drive him firmly in place like a nail in the wall. They will give him great responsibility, and he will bring honor to even the lowliest members of his family.”\nBut the LORD of Heaven’s Armies also says: “The time will come when I will pull out the nail that seemed so firm. It will come out and fall to the ground. Everything it supports will fall with it. I, the LORD, have spoken!”",

I am placing a foundation stone in Jerusalem,\na firm and tested stone.\nIt is a precious cornerstone that is safe to build on.\nWhoever believes need never be shaken.\nI will test you with the measuring line of justice\nand the plumb line of righteousness.\nSince your refuge is made of lies,\na hailstorm will knock it down.\nSince it is made of deception,\na flood will sweep it away.\nI will cancel the bargain you made to cheat death,\nand I will overturn your deal to dodge the grave.\nWhen the terrible enemy sweeps through,\nyou will be trampled into the ground.\nAgain and again that flood will come,\nmorning after morning,\nday and night,\nuntil you are carried away.”\n\nThis message will bring terror to your people.\nThe bed you have made is too short to lie on.\nThe blankets are too narrow to cover you.\nThe LORD will come as he did against the Philistines at Mount Perazim\nand against the Amorites at Gibeon.\nHe will come to do a strange thing;\nhe will come to do an unusual deed:\nFor the Lord, the LORD of Heaven’s Armies,\nhas plainly said that he is determined to crush the whole land.\nSo scoff no more,\nor your punishment will be even greater.\n\nListen to me;\nlisten, and pay close attention.\nDoes a farmer always plow and never sow?\nIs he forever cultivating the soil and never planting?\nDoes he not finally plant his seeds—\nblack cumin, cumin, wheat, barley, and emmer wheat—\neach in its proper way,\nand each in its proper place?\nThe farmer knows just what to do,\nfor God has given him understanding.\nA heavy sledge is never used to thresh black cumin;\nrather, it is beaten with a light stick.\nA threshing wheel is never rolled on cumin;\ninstead, it is beaten lightly with a flail.\nGrain for bread is easily crushed,\nso he doesn’t keep on pounding it.\nHe threshes it under the wheels of a cart,\nbut he doesn’t pulverize it.\nThe LORD of Heaven’s Armies is a wonderful teacher,\nand he gives the farmer great wisdom.",

When you give it to those who can read, they will say, “We can’t read it because it is sealed.” When you give it to those who cannot read, they will say, “We don’t know how to read.”\n\nAnd so the Lord says,\n“These people say they are mine.\nThey honor me with their lips,\nbut their hearts are far from me.\nAnd their worship of me\nis nothing but man-made rules learned by rote.\nBecause of this, I will once again astound these hypocrites\nwith amazing wonders.\nThe wisdom of the wise will pass away,\nand the intelligence of the intelligent will disappear.”\n\nWhat sorrow awaits those who try to hide their plans from the LORD,\nwho do their evil deeds in the dark!\n“The LORD can’t see us,” they say.\n“He doesn’t know what’s going on!”\nHow foolish can you be?\nHe is the Potter, and he is certainly greater than you, the clay!\nShould the created thing say of the one who made it,\n“He didn’t make me”?\nDoes a jar ever say,\n“The potter who made me is stupid”?\n\nSoon—and it will not be very long—\nthe forests of Lebanon will become a fertile field,\nand the fertile field will yield bountiful crops.\nIn that day the deaf will hear words read from a book,\nand the blind will see through the gloom and darkness.\nThe humble will be filled with fresh joy from the LORD.\nThe poor will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.\nThe scoffer will be gone,\nthe arrogant will disappear,\nand those who plot evil will be killed.\nThose who convict the innocent\nby their false testimony will disappear.\nA similar fate awaits those who use trickery to pervert justice\nand who tell lies to destroy the innocent.\n\nThat is why the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, says to the people of Israel,\n\n“My people will no longer be ashamed\nor turn pale with fear.\nFor when they see their many children\nand all the blessings I have given them,\nthey will recognize the holiness of the Holy One of Jacob.\nThey will stand in awe of the God of Israel.\nThen the wayward will gain understanding,\nand complainers will accept instruction.",

There will be wonderful harvests and plenty of pastureland for your livestock. The oxen and donkeys that till the ground will eat good grain, its chaff blown away by the wind. In that day, when your enemies are slaughtered and the towers fall, there will be streams of water flowing down every mountain and hill. The moon will be as bright as the sun, and the sun will be seven times brighter—like the light of seven days in one! So it will be when the LORD begins to heal his people and cure the wounds he gave them.\n\nLook! The LORD is coming from far away,\nburning with anger,\nsurrounded by thick, rising smoke.\nHis lips are filled with fury;\nhis words consume like fire.\nHis hot breath pours out like a flood\nup to the neck of his enemies.\nHe will sift out the proud nations for destruction.\nHe will bridle them and lead them away to ruin.\n\nBut the people of God will sing a song of joy,\nlike the songs at the holy festivals.\nYou will be filled with joy,\nas when a flutist leads a group of pilgrims\nto Jerusalem, the mountain of the LORD—\nto the Rock of Israel.\nAnd the LORD will make his majestic voice heard.\nHe will display the strength of his mighty arm.\nIt will descend with devouring flames,\nwith cloudbursts, thunderstorms, and huge hailstones.\nAt the LORD’s command, the Assyrians will be shattered.\nHe will strike them down with his royal scepter.\nAnd as the LORD strikes them with his rod of punishment,\nhis people will celebrate with tambourines and harps.\nLifting his mighty arm, he will fight the Assyrians.\nTopheth—the place of burning—\nhas long been ready for the Assyrian king;\nthe pyre is piled high with wood.\nThe breath of the LORD, like fire from a volcano,\nwill set it ablaze.",

Then the king of Assyria sent his chief of staff from Lachish with a huge army to confront King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. The Assyrians took up a position beside the aqueduct that feeds water into the upper pool, near the road leading to the field where cloth is washed.\nThese are the officials who went out to meet with them: Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace administrator; Shebna the court secretary; and Joah son of Asaph, the royal historian.\n\nThen the Assyrian king’s chief of staff told them to give this message to Hezekiah:\n\n“This is what the great king of Assyria says: What are you trusting in that makes you so confident? Do you think that mere words can substitute for military skill and strength? Who are you counting on, that you have rebelled against me? On Egypt? If you lean on Egypt, it will be like a reed that splinters beneath your weight and pierces your hand. Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is completely unreliable!\n“But perhaps you will say to me, ‘We are trusting in the LORD our God!’ But isn’t he the one who was insulted by Hezekiah? Didn’t Hezekiah tear down his shrines and altars and make everyone in Judah and Jerusalem worship only at the altar here in Jerusalem?\n“I’ll tell you what! Strike a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria. I will give you 2,000 horses if you can find that many men to ride on them! With your tiny army, how can you think of challenging even the weakest contingent of my master’s troops, even with the help of Egypt’s chariots and charioteers? What’s more, do you think we have invaded your land without the LORD’s direction? The LORD himself told us, ‘Attack this land and destroy it!’”\n\nThen Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Assyrian chief of staff, “Please speak to us in Aramaic, for we understand it well. Don’t speak in Hebrew, for the people on the wall will hear.”\nBut Sennacherib’s chief of staff replied, “Do you think my master sent this message only to you and your master? He wants all the people to hear it, for when we put this city under siege, they will suffer along with you. They will be so hungry and thirsty that they will eat their own dung and drink their own urine.”\nThen the chief of staff stood and shouted in Hebrew to the people on the wall, “Listen to this message from the great king of Assyria! This is what the king says: Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you. He will never be able to rescue you. Don’t let him fool you into trusting in the LORD by saying, ‘The LORD will surely rescue us. This city will never fall into the hands of the Assyrian king!’\n“Don’t listen to Hezekiah! These are the terms the king of Assyria is offering: Make peace with me—open the gates and come out. Then each of you can continue eating from your own grapevine and fig tree and drinking from your own well. Then I will arrange to take you to another land like this one—a land of grain and new wine, bread and vineyards.\n“Don’t let Hezekiah mislead you by saying, ‘The LORD will rescue us!’ Have the gods of any other nations ever saved their people from the king of Assyria? What happened to the gods of Hamath and Arpad? And what about the gods of Sepharvaim? Did any god rescue Samaria from my power? What god of any nation has ever been able to save its people from my power? So what makes you think that the LORD can rescue Jerusalem from me?”\nBut the people were silent and did not utter a word because Hezekiah had commanded them, “Do not answer him.”\nThen Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace administrator; Shebna the court secretary; and Joah son of Asaph, the royal historian, went back to Hezekiah. They tore their clothes in despair, and they went in to see the king and told him what the Assyrian chief of staff had said.",

      "chapter_text": "LORD\nWhen King Hezekiah heard their report, he tore his clothes and put on burlap and went into the Temple of the LORD. And he sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the court secretary, and the leading priests, all dressed in burlap, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. They told him, “This is what King Hezekiah says: Today is a day of trouble, insults, and disgrace. It is like when a child is ready to be born, but the mother has no strength to deliver the baby. But perhaps the LORD your God has heard the Assyrian chief of staff, sent by the king to defy the living God, and will punish him for his words. Oh, pray for those of us who are left!”\nAfter King Hezekiah’s officials delivered the king’s message to Isaiah, the prophet replied, “Say to your master, ‘This is what the LORD says: Do not be disturbed by this blasphemous speech against me from the Assyrian king’s messengers. Listen! I myself will move against him, and the king will receive a message that he is needed at home. So he will return to his land, where I will have him killed with a sword.’”\nMeanwhile, the Assyrian chief of staff left Jerusalem and went to consult the king of Assyria, who had left Lachish and was attacking Libnah.\nSoon afterward King Sennacherib received word that King Tirhakah of Ethiopia was leading an army to fight against him. Before leaving to meet the attack, he sent messengers back to Hezekiah in Jerusalem with this message:\n\n“This message is for King Hezekiah of Judah. Don’t let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you with promises that Jerusalem will not be captured by the king of Assyria. You know perfectly well what the kings of Assyria have done wherever they have gone. They have completely destroyed everyone who stood in their way! Why should you be any different? Have the gods of other nations rescued them—such nations as Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Tel-assar? My predecessors destroyed them all! What happened to the king of Hamath and the king of Arpad? What happened to the kings of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?”\n\nAfter Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it, he went up to the LORD’s Temple and spread it out before the LORD. And Hezekiah prayed this prayer before the LORD: “O LORD of Heaven’s Armies, God of Israel, you are enthroned between the mighty cherubim! You alone are God of all the kingdoms of the earth. You alone created the heavens and the earth. Bend down, O LORD, and listen! Open your eyes, O LORD, and see! Listen to Sennacherib’s words of defiance against the living God.\n“It is true, LORD, that the kings of Assyria have destroyed all these nations. And they have thrown the gods of these nations into the fire and burned them. But of course the Assyrians could destroy them! They were not gods at all—only idols of wood and stone shaped by human hands. Now, O LORD our God, rescue us from his power; then all the kingdoms of the earth will know that you alone, O LORD, are God.”\n\nThen Isaiah son of Amoz sent this message to Hezekiah: “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Because you prayed about King Sennacherib of Assyria, the LORD has spoken this word against him:\n\n“The virgin daughter of Zion\ndespises you and laughs at you.\nThe daughter of Jerusalem\nshakes her head in derision as you flee.\n\n“Whom have you been defying and ridiculing?\nAgainst whom did you raise your voice?\nAt whom did you look with such haughty eyes?\nIt was the Holy One of Israel!\nBy your messengers you have defied the Lord.\nYou have said, ‘With my many chariots\nI have conquered the highest mountains—\nyes, the remotest peaks of Lebanon.\nI have cut down its tallest cedars\nand its finest cypress trees.\nI have reached its farthest heights\nand explored its deepest forests.\nI have dug wells in many foreign lands\nand refreshed myself with their water.\nWith the sole of my foot,\nI stopped up all the rivers of Egypt!’\n\n“But have you not heard?\nI decided this long ago.\nLong ago I planned it,\nand now I am making it happen.\nI planned for you to crush fortified cities\ninto heaps of rubble.\nThat is why their people have so little power\nand are so frightened and confused.\nThey are as weak as grass,\nas easily trampled as tender green shoots.\nThey are like grass sprouting on a housetop,\nscorched before it can grow lush and tall.\n\n“But I know you well—\nwhere you stay\nand when you come and go.\nI know the way you have raged against me.\nAnd because of your raging against me\nand your arrogance, which I have heard for myself,\nI will put my hook in your nose\nand my bit in your mouth.\nI will make you return\nby the same road on which you came.”\n\nThen Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Here is the proof that what I say is true:\n\n“This year you will eat only what grows up by itself,\nand next year you will eat what springs up from that.\nBut in the third year you will plant crops and harvest them;\nyou will tend vineyards and eat their fruit.\nAnd you who are left in Judah,\nwho have escaped the ravages of the siege,\nwill put roots down in your own soil\nand grow up and flourish.\nFor a remnant of my people will spread out from Jerusalem,\na group of survivors from Mount Zion.\nThe passionate commitment of the LORD of Heaven’s Armies\nwill make this happen!\n\n“And this is what the LORD says about the king of Assyria:\n\n“‘His armies will not enter Jerusalem.\nThey will not even shoot an arrow at it.\nThey will not march outside its gates with their shields\nnor build banks of earth against its walls.\nThe king will return to his own country\nby the same road on which he came.\nHe will not enter this city,’\nsays the LORD.\n‘For my own honor and for the sake of my servant David,\nI will defend this city and protect it.’”\n\nThat night the angel of the LORD went out to the Assyrian camp and killed 185,000 Assyrian soldiers. When the surviving Assyrians woke up the next morning, they found corpses everywhere. Then King Sennacherib of Assyria broke camp and returned to his own land. He went home to his capital of Nineveh and stayed there.\nOne day while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with their swords. They then escaped to the land of Ararat, and another son, Esarhaddon, became the next king of Assyria.",

I will add fifteen years to your life, and I will rescue you and this city from the king of Assyria. Yes, I will defend this city.\n“‘And this is the sign from the LORD to prove that he will do as he promised: I will cause the sun’s shadow to move ten steps backward on the sundial of Ahaz!’” So the shadow on the sundial moved backward ten steps.\n\nWhen King Hezekiah was well again, he wrote this poem:\n\nI said, “In the prime of my life,\nmust I now enter the place of the dead?\nAm I to be robbed of the rest of my years?”\nI said, “Never again will I see the LORD GOD\nwhile still in the land of the living.\nNever again will I see my friends\nor be with those who live in this world.\nMy life has been blown away\nlike a shepherd’s tent in a storm.\nIt has been cut short,\nas when a weaver cuts cloth from a loom.\nSuddenly, my life was over.\nI waited patiently all night,\nbut I was torn apart as though by lions.\nSuddenly, my life was over.\nDelirious, I chattered like a swallow or a crane,\nand then I moaned like a mourning dove.\nMy eyes grew tired of looking to heaven for help.\nI am in trouble, Lord. Help me!”\n\nBut what could I say?\nFor he himself sent this sickness.\nNow I will walk humbly throughout my years\nbecause of this anguish I have felt.\nLord, your discipline is good,\nfor it leads to life and health.\nYou restore my health\nand allow me to live!\nYes, this anguish was good for me,\nfor you have rescued me from death\nand forgiven all my sins.\nFor the dead cannot praise you;\nthey cannot raise their voices in praise.\nThose who go down to the grave\ncan no longer hope in your faithfulness.\nOnly the living can praise you as I do today.\nEach generation tells of your faithfulness to the next.\nThink of it—the LORD is ready to heal me!\nI will sing his praises with instruments\nevery day of my life\nin the Temple of the LORD.\n\nIsaiah had said to Hezekiah’s servants, “Make an ointment from figs and spread it over the boil, and Hezekiah will recover.”\nAnd Hezekiah had asked, “What sign will prove that I will go to the Temple of the LORD?”",

It’s the voice of someone shouting,\n“Clear the way through the wilderness\nfor the LORD!\nMake a straight highway through the wasteland\nfor our God!\nFill in the valleys,\nand level the mountains and hills.\nStraighten the curves,\nand smooth out the rough places.\nThen the glory of the LORD will be revealed,\nand all people will see it together.\nThe LORD has spoken!”\n\nA voice said, “Shout!”\nI asked, “What should I shout?”\n\n“Shout that people are like the grass.\nTheir beauty fades as quickly\nas the flowers in a field.\nThe grass withers and the flowers fade\nbeneath the breath of the LORD.\nAnd so it is with people.\nThe grass withers and the flowers fade,\nbut the word of our God stands forever.”\n\nO Zion, messenger of good news,\nshout from the mountaintops!\nShout it louder, O Jerusalem.\nShout, and do not be afraid.\nTell the towns of Judah,\n“Your God is coming!”\nYes, the Sovereign LORD is coming in power.\nHe will rule with a powerful arm.\nSee, he brings his reward with him as he comes.\nHe will feed his flock like a shepherd.\nHe will carry the lambs in his arms,\nholding them close to his heart.\nHe will gently lead the mother sheep with their young.\nLORD\nWho else has held the oceans in his hand?\nWho has measured off the heavens with his fingers?\nWho else knows the weight of the earth\nor has weighed the mountains and hills on a scale?\nWho is able to advise the Spirit of the LORD?\nWho knows enough to give him advice or teach him?\nHas the LORD ever needed anyone’s advice?\nDoes he need instruction about what is good?\nDid someone teach him what is right\nor show him the path of justice?\n\nNo, for all the nations of the world\nare but a drop in the bucket.\nThey are nothing more\nthan dust on the scales.\nHe picks up the whole earth\nas though it were a grain of sand.\nAll the wood in Lebanon’s forests\nand all Lebanon’s animals would not be enough\nto make a burnt offering worthy of our God.\nThe nations of the world are worth nothing to him.\nIn his eyes they count for less than nothing—\nmere emptiness and froth.\n\nTo whom can you compare God?\nWhat image can you find to resemble him?\nCan he be compared to an idol formed in a mold,\noverlaid with gold, and decorated with silver chains?\nOr if people are too poor for that,\nthey might at least choose wood that won’t decay\nand a skilled craftsman\nto carve an image that won’t fall down!\n\nHaven’t you heard? Don’t you understand?\nAre you deaf to the words of God—\nthe words he gave before the world began?\nAre you so ignorant?\nGod sits above the circle of the earth.\nThe people below seem like grasshoppers to him!\nHe spreads out the heavens like a curtain\nand makes his tent from them.\nHe judges the great people of the world\nand brings them all to nothing.\nThey hardly get started, barely taking root,\nwhen he blows on them and they wither.\nThe wind carries them off like chaff.\n\n“To whom will you compare me?\nWho is my equal?” asks the Holy One.\n\nLook up into the heavens.\nWho created all the stars?\nHe brings them out like an army, one after another,\ncalling each by its name.\nBecause of his great power and incomparable strength,\nnot a single one is missing.\nO Jacob, how can you say the LORD does not see your troubles?\nO Israel, how can you say God ignores your rights?\nHave you never heard?\nHave you never understood?\nThe LORD is the everlasting God,\nthe Creator of all the earth.\nHe never grows weak or weary.\nNo one can measure the depths of his understanding.\nHe gives power to the weak\nand strength to the powerless.\nEven youths will become weak and tired,\nand young men will fall in exhaustion.\nBut those who trust in the LORD will find new strength.\nThey will soar high on wings like eagles.\nThey will run and not grow weary.\nThey will walk and not faint.",

I am here to help you.\nThough you are a lowly worm, O Jacob,\ndon’t be afraid, people of Israel, for I will help you.\nI am the LORD, your Redeemer.\nI am the Holy One of Israel.’\nYou will be a new threshing instrument\nwith many sharp teeth.\nYou will tear your enemies apart,\nmaking chaff of mountains.\nYou will toss them into the air,\nand the wind will blow them all away;\na whirlwind will scatter them.\nThen you will rejoice in the LORD.\nYou will glory in the Holy One of Israel.\n\n“When the poor and needy search for water and there is none,\nand their tongues are parched from thirst,\nthen I, the LORD, will answer them.\nI, the God of Israel, will never abandon them.\nI will open up rivers for them on the high plateaus.\nI will give them fountains of water in the valleys.\nI will fill the desert with pools of water.\nRivers fed by springs will flow across the parched ground.\nI will plant trees in the barren desert—\ncedar, acacia, myrtle, olive, cypress, fir, and pine.\nI am doing this so all who see this miracle\nwill understand what it means—\nthat it is the LORD who has done this,\nthe Holy One of Israel who created it.\n\n“Present the case for your idols,”\nsays the LORD.\n“Let them show what they can do,”\nsays the King of Israel.\n“Let them try to tell us what happened long ago\nso that we may consider the evidence.\nOr let them tell us what the future holds,\nso we can know what’s going to happen.\nYes, tell us what will occur in the days ahead.\nThen we will know you are gods.\nIn fact, do anything—good or bad!\nDo something that will amaze and frighten us.\nBut no! You are less than nothing and can do nothing at all.\nThose who choose you pollute themselves.\n\n“But I have stirred up a leader who will approach from the north.\nFrom the east he will call on my name.\nI will give him victory over kings and princes.\nHe will trample them as a potter treads on clay.\n\n“Who told you from the beginning\nthat this would happen?\nWho predicted this,\nmaking you admit that he was right?\nNo one said a word!\nI was the first to tell Zion,\n‘Look! Help is on the way!’\nI will send Jerusalem a messenger with good news.\nNot one of your idols told you this.\nNot one gave any answer when I asked.\nSee, they are all foolish, worthless things.\nAll your idols are as empty as the wind.",

Can a mother forget her nursing child?\nCan she feel no love for the child she has borne?\nBut even if that were possible,\nI would not forget you!\nSee, I have written your name on the palms of my hands.\nAlways in my mind is a picture of Jerusalem’s walls in ruins.\nSoon your descendants will come back,\nand all who are trying to destroy you will go away.\nLook around you and see,\nfor all your children will come back to you.\nAs surely as I live,” says the LORD,\n“they will be like jewels or bridal ornaments for you to display.\n\n“Even the most desolate parts of your abandoned land\nwill soon be crowded with your people.\nYour enemies who enslaved you\nwill be far away.\nThe generations born in exile will return and say,\n‘We need more room! It’s crowded here!’\nThen you will think to yourself,\n‘Who has given me all these descendants?\nFor most of my children were killed,\nand the rest were carried away into exile.\nI was left here all alone.\nWhere did all these people come from?\nWho bore these children?\nWho raised them for me?’”\n\nThis is what the Sovereign LORD says:\n“See, I will give a signal to the godless nations.\nThey will carry your little sons back to you in their arms;\nthey will bring your daughters on their shoulders.\nKings and queens will serve you\nand care for all your needs.\nThey will bow to the earth before you\nand lick the dust from your feet.\nThen you will know that I am the LORD.\nThose who trust in me will never be put to shame.”\n\nWho can snatch the plunder of war from the hands of a warrior?\nWho can demand that a tyrant let his captives go?\nBut the LORD says,\n“The captives of warriors will be released,\nand the plunder of tyrants will be retrieved.\nFor I will fight those who fight you,\nand I will save your children.\nI will feed your enemies with their own flesh.\nThey will be drunk with rivers of their own blood.\nAll the world will know that I, the LORD,\nam your Savior and your Redeemer,\nthe Mighty One of Israel.”",

Clothe yourself with strength!\nFlex your mighty right arm!\nRouse yourself as in the days of old\nwhen you slew Egypt, the dragon of the Nile.\nAre you not the same today,\nthe one who dried up the sea,\nmaking a path of escape through the depths\nso that your people could cross over?\nThose who have been ransomed by the LORD will return.\nThey will enter Jerusalem singing,\ncrowned with everlasting joy.\nSorrow and mourning will disappear,\nand they will be filled with joy and gladness.\n\n“I, yes I, am the one who comforts you.\nSo why are you afraid of mere humans,\nwho wither like the grass and disappear?\nYet you have forgotten the LORD, your Creator,\nthe one who stretched out the sky like a canopy\nand laid the foundations of the earth.\nWill you remain in constant dread of human oppressors?\nWill you continue to fear the anger of your enemies?\nWhere is their fury and anger now?\nIt is gone!\nSoon all you captives will be released!\nImprisonment, starvation, and death will not be your fate!\nFor I am the LORD your God,\nwho stirs up the sea, causing its waves to roar.\nMy name is the LORD of Heaven’s Armies.\nAnd I have put my words in your mouth\nand hidden you safely in my hand.\nI stretched out the sky like a canopy\nand laid the foundations of the earth.\nI am the one who says to Israel,\n‘You are my people!’”\n\nWake up, wake up, O Jerusalem!\nYou have drunk the cup of the LORD’s fury.\nYou have drunk the cup of terror,\ntipping out its last drops.\nNot one of your children is left alive\nto take your hand and guide you.\nThese two calamities have fallen on you:\ndesolation and destruction, famine and war.\nAnd who is left to sympathize with you?\nWho is left to comfort you?\nFor your children have fainted and lie in the streets,\nhelpless as antelopes caught in a net.\nThe LORD has poured out his fury;\nGod has rebuked them.\n\nBut now listen to this, you afflicted ones\nwho sit in a drunken stupor,\nthough not from drinking wine.\nThis is what the Sovereign LORD,\nyour God and Defender, says:\n“See, I have taken the terrible cup from your hands.\nYou will drink no more of my fury.\nInstead, I will hand that cup to your tormentors,\nthose who said, ‘We will trample you into the dust\nand walk on your backs.’”",

I am creating new heavens and a new earth,\nand no one will even think about the old ones anymore.\nBe glad; rejoice forever in my creation!\nAnd look! I will create Jerusalem as a place of happiness.\nHer people will be a source of joy.\nI will rejoice over Jerusalem\nand delight in my people.\nAnd the sound of weeping and crying\nwill be heard in it no more.\n\n“No longer will babies die when only a few days old.\nNo longer will adults die before they have lived a full life.\nNo longer will people be considered old at one hundred!\nOnly the cursed will die that young!\nIn those days people will live in the houses they build\nand eat the fruit of their own vineyards.\nUnlike the past, invaders will not take their houses\nand confiscate their vineyards.\nFor my people will live as long as trees,\nand my chosen ones will have time to enjoy their hard-won gains.\nThey will not work in vain,\nand their children will not be doomed to misfortune.\nFor they are people blessed by the LORD,\nand their children, too, will be blessed.\nI will answer them before they even call to me.\nWhile they are still talking about their needs,\nI will go ahead and answer their prayers!\nThe wolf and the lamb will feed together.\nThe lion will eat hay like a cow.\nBut the snakes will eat dust.\nIn those days no one will be hurt or destroyed on my holy mountain.\nI, the LORD, have spoken!”",

I would never keep this nation from being born,”\nsays your God.\n\n“Rejoice with Jerusalem!\nBe glad with her, all you who love her\nand all you who mourn for her.\nDrink deeply of her glory\neven as an infant drinks at its mother’s comforting breasts.”\n\nThis is what the LORD says:\n“I will give Jerusalem a river of peace and prosperity.\nThe wealth of the nations will flow to her.\nHer children will be nursed at her breasts,\ncarried in her arms, and held on her lap.\nI will comfort you there in Jerusalem\nas a mother comforts her child.”\n\nWhen you see these things, your heart will rejoice.\nYou will flourish like the grass!\nEveryone will see the LORD’s hand of blessing on his servants—\nand his anger against his enemies.\nSee, the LORD is coming with fire,\nand his swift chariots roar like a whirlwind.\nHe will bring punishment with the fury of his anger\nand the flaming fire of his hot rebuke.\nThe LORD will punish the world by fire\nand by his sword.\nHe will judge the earth,\nand many will be killed by him.\n\n“Those who ‘consecrate’ and ‘purify’ themselves in a sacred garden with its idol in the center—feasting on pork and rats and other detestable meats—will come to a terrible end,” says the LORD.\n“I can see what they are doing, and I know what they are thinking. So I will gather all nations and peoples together, and they will see my glory. I will perform a sign among them. And I will send those who survive to be messengers to the nations—to Tarshish, to the Libyans and Lydians (who are famous as archers), to Tubal and Greece, and to all the lands beyond the sea that have not heard of my fame or seen my glory. There they will declare my glory to the nations. They will bring the remnant of your people back from every nation. They will bring them to my holy mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the LORD. They will ride on horses, in chariots and wagons, and on mules and camels,” says the LORD. “And I will appoint some of them to be my priests and Levites. I, the LORD, have spoken!\n\n“As surely as my new heavens and earth will remain,\nso will you always be my people,\nwith a name that will never disappear,”\nsays the LORD.\n“All humanity will come to worship me\nfrom week to week\nand from month to month.\nAnd as they go out, they will see\nthe dead bodies of those who have rebelled against me.\nFor the worms that devour them will never die,\nand the fire that burns them will never go out.\nAll who pass by\nwill view them with utter horror.”",
